# Wolfpack Product Bundles — App Navigation & UI Map

> **KEEP THIS UP TO DATE.**
> Any time a new page, modal, tab, sidebar section, or user flow is added or removed,
> this document **must** be updated. See CLAUDE.md for the enforcement rule.

**Last Updated:** 2026-09-23
**Environment mapped:** SIT (`wolfpack-product-bundles-sit`)
**Test store:** `wolfpack-store-test-1.myshopify.com`

All merchant-facing Admin pages expose both the Shopify Admin breadcrumb and an
app-owned back arrow. Dashboard, the `/app` splash/home entry point, billing
callbacks, and resource/API routes are excluded. Both controls share the same
page callback so configure and Settings dirty-state guards cannot be bypassed.
The public root `/` preserves its query string and redirects to `/app`; the
authenticated app layout owns Admin authentication.

---

## 1. Top-Level Shell

The app runs inside the Shopify Admin embedded iframe. The outer Shopify Admin shell
provides a persistent left-nav with the app's registered nav items.

Shopify's app name owns the `/app` home link. The first `/app` entry in an Admin
tab renders a native Only Bundles splash; later app-name visits in that tab
replace-route to the dashboard. The app registers only true sub-navigation items,
so Dashboard is not duplicated beneath the app name. First-create guidance begins
only after a successful bundle creation.

Destination flow:

```
first /app entry in an Admin tab
└── native Only Bundles splash
    └── [Take me to my dashboard]  → /app/dashboard

later /app entry in the same tab   → /app/dashboard
```

### Shopify Admin Left Nav (app section)

```
Wolfpack Bundles SIT
├── [app name / home]   → /app                    (first-entry splash, then Dashboard)
├── Settings            → /app/settings
├── Integrations        → /app/integrations
├── Analytics           → /app/attribution
├── Offer operations    → /app/offer-operations
├── Feature requests    → /app/feature-requests   (Canny board)
└── Billing             → /app/billing          (Subscription & Billing)
```

Pathname-changing navigation uses Shopify's native Admin header loading
indicator and keeps the current route visible until the destination commits.
Same-screen submissions and revalidation do not start it.

**Screenshot:** `screenshots/02-dashboard.png`

---

## 2. Page-by-Page Map

### Feature requests — `/app/feature-requests`

Authenticated route with native Polaris page shell, shared back navigation,
loading indicator, retryable errors, and the official Canny board embed. Stores
can browse/search, submit, vote, and comment using one Shopify-store identity.
The GET resource `/app/canny/session` authenticates with Shopify, reads canonical
Shop GID/name/email, and returns a short-lived Canny SSO JWT with `no-store`.
`basePath: null` keeps Canny from rewriting embedded Admin URLs. Hosted public
Canny URLs remain the targets for sharing/email; no retired `/app/events` route
is restored. See `internal docs/Operations/Canny.md` for setup and release gates.

### 2.1 Dashboard — `/app/dashboard`

**Route file:** `app/routes/app/app.dashboard/route.tsx`
**Screenshot:** `screenshots/02-dashboard.png`

```

Dashboard preview behavior:

- Product-page bundle preview opens `/products/{shopifyProductHandle}`.
- Every full-page bundle preview requests a new one-hour signed `wpb_preview` URL on each click; active and unlisted bundles remain publicly accessible at the canonical URL without the token.
- First successful preview records the Admin `bundle_previewed` event with bundle id, type, status, and link.
- The bundle table uses Polaris automatic table/list presentation: desktop keeps Name, Status, Type, and Actions columns, while phone containers expose the same record fields and row actions as a stacked list.
- Core bundle work stays above support and education content: create actions, filters, and bundle actions render before the support cards.
- The persistent Storefront status section appears immediately after the support cards, reports Shopify's published-theme state for every known embed and block, and cannot be dismissed.
- The inactive App Embed Enable action opens the App Embed Enable modal; it does not navigate or mark the embed active by itself.
- The 30-day performance section streams after the status section. Money is normalized from Shopify MoneyBag presentment/shop amounts into the shop currency; incomplete conversion data fails the whole section rather than mixing currencies.

App Embed Enable modal:

```
App Embed Enable
├── Idle: instructional video + Open Theme Editor + Cancel
├── Detecting: spinner while Shopify App Bridge checks the published theme
├── Success: confirmed enabled status + Done
└── Failure: retry Theme Editor + existing support chat action
```

The Theme Editor action uses the existing `activateAppId` deep link. Focus and
visibility returns are deduplicated into one `shopify.app.extensions()` check;
only a confirmed active `bundle-app-embed` changes its resource row to enabled.

#### "Create Bundle" Button

Navigates to: `/app/bundles/create` (bundle type selection entry)

---

### 2.1a Create Bundle Entry — `/app/bundles/create`

**Route file:** `app/routes/app/app.bundles.create/route.tsx`

```
Create Bundle Entry
├── Header: "Select bundle builder type" + "How do bundle builder types work?" link
├── Bundle Type cards: Product Page Builder / Full Page Builder
├── [Button] "Next" / Continue
└── Modal: Bundle name only
    ├── TextField: Bundle name (required, min 3 chars)
    └── [Button] Save → POST action → redirect to existing configure page
```

Create redirect targets:

```
Product Page: `/app/bundles/product-page-bundle/configure/:bundleId?mode=create`
Full Page: `/app/bundles/full-page-bundle/configure/:bundleId?mode=create`
First-install first-bundle tour adds: `&first_load=true`
```

The first-install eligibility claim is consumed only after the bundle and its
required Shopify parent product are created. The subsequent widget-status check
is noncritical; a timeout or error leaves creation successful and the configure
redirect intact.

#### Shopify Sidekick Create Bridge

Shopify's `admin.app.intent.link` opens the same `/app/bundles/create` page for a
`shopify/product` `import` intent. Incoming intent data and the registered
`stage_bundle_draft` tool can prefill the name and bundle type, but do not submit
the form. The merchant must click Save. A Sidekick-marked POST reuses the normal
create handler and returns the new parent Product GID to
`shopify.intents.response.ok({id})`; ordinary submissions keep the redirects
listed above. Back navigation during an active intent resolves it as closed and
does not create a bundle.

#### Shopify Sidekick Bundle Data Route

**Route file:** `app/routes/app/app.sidekick.bundles.tsx`

**URL:** `/app/sidekick/bundles`

The headless `admin.app.tools.data` extension posts bundle search and summary
operations to this authenticated resource route. The route returns current-shop,
read-only JSON with `app://` links to existing FPB or PPB configure pages. It is
not a merchant-facing page; GET returns `405` after authentication.

#### Shopify Bundled Products Edit Bridge

**Route file:** `app/routes/app/app.bundles.products.$productId/route.tsx`

**URL:** `/app/bundles/products/:productId`

Shopify's product-configuration extension supplies the numeric `{product_id}`. The authenticated loader resolves the matching `Bundle.shopifyProductId` within the current shop and redirects to the existing FPB or PPB configure page. Invalid IDs return `400`; missing or foreign bundles return `404`. The route renders no separate page.

Configure page storefront sync status:

- Full-page and product-page configure pages do not show a separate Storefront sync status or retry banner.
- Save persists DB changes and publishes Shopify storefront data synchronously before returning a compact success response.
- Existing Sync Bundle actions run the same direct storefront sync path, including native scheduled-discount owner reconciliation and current policy publication.
- FPB, PPB and SDK additions serialize metafield sync and cart add with Web Locks. Capacity/conflict failures stop the addition; cart add is never retried blindly.
- Preview Bundle reserves a tab synchronously and posts one compact `/prepare-preview` request; FPB receives a fresh signed app-proxy URL in that response, while PPB receives its preview token. The reserved tab navigates after the response so popup protection does not discard it. Failed checks close the blank tab and surface through the preview error toast while the button spinner is active.
- Bundle creation and cloning route directly to the bundle type's configure page; there is no intermediate configuration wizard route.

#### Modal: Delete Bundle Confirmation

Triggered by: "Delete" row action

```
Delete Confirmation Modal (centered, small)
├── "Are you sure you want to delete [bundle name]?"
└── [Button] "Delete" / [Button] "Cancel"
```

---

### 2.2 Settings — `/app/settings`

**Route file:** `app/routes/app/app.settings.tsx`

Admin Settings hub:

```
Settings
├── App Bridge breadcrumb: Dashboard back action + Settings title
├── App-owned header: arrow-only back action + Settings title
├── Card: Design
│   └── Opens the preview-first Design workspace
│       ├── Template, component surface, and desktop/mobile selectors above the isolated storefront preview canvas
│       ├── One contextual inspector for the component visible in the preview
│       ├── Phone panes: Preview / Customize
│       ├── Contextual colors inherit Shopify Shop Brand pairs until individually overridden
│       ├── Nested route `/settings-design-preview-frame` renders deterministic FPB/PPB fixtures with production controllers and CSS
│       └── Preview Bundle modal lists saved, storefront-ready active/unlisted FPB and PPB bundles
├── Card: Language
│   └── Shows multilanguage mode, 39 add/remove locale choices, shared Cart & Checkout strings, Landing Page Layout strings, and Product Page Layout strings
└── Card: Controls
    └── Navigates to /app/settings/controls
```

Primary action:

- The complete Design, Language, and Controls cards are the actions; they do not render separate `Configure` affordances.
- Selecting Design opens the Settings -> Design subpage.
- Selecting Controls keeps the landing cards visible while Shopify's native Admin loading indicator reports navigation to `/app/settings/controls`.
- While the lazy Design or Language workspace loads after selection, the destination title and a small Polaris spinner render without card skeletons or an artificial delay.
- The Design Control Panel lazy-loads after entry and uses a responsive preview-first workspace: the gutterless preview stage and its selectors sit beside one contextual inspector. On desktop, a vertically centered notch with a Polaris chevron straddles the preview/inspector boundary, remains centered in the visible sidebar edge while scrolling, and collapses the inspector so the width-driven storefront canvas grows without clearing unsaved settings or preview context. Canvas fitting is applied once per browser frame without React resize state or scale transitions. The canvas shows a centered Polaris spinner card and remains visually withheld until the isolated preview frame sends its trusted `READY` event. Mobile selection preserves the full 390 x 844 storefront viewport inside a decorative iPhone body whose chrome sits outside the iframe. At phone Admin widths the notch is hidden and a Preview / Customize segmented control remains the authoritative one-pane-at-a-time navigation.
- Preview-only Bundle Type and Template selectors cover Landing Page Standard, Classic, Compact, and Horizontal plus Product Page Product List, Product Grid, Horizontal Slots, and Vertical Slots.
- The template-aware Edit area control exposes only persistent regions owned by the selected template: Bundle header, Navigation, Categories, Product cards, Product slots, and Cart / summary. Selecting an area returns the separate Preview state control to Default, scrolls the production region into view, and identifies it with a persistent outline and localized `Editing` label.
- The separate Preview state control exposes only applicable transient states: Default, Product picker, Loading, Validation, and Upsell. Product picker is limited to PPB slot templates, Loading is available to all FPB and PPB templates, and state dismissal/default restores the previously selected edit area.
- Images & GIFs owns the store-level FPB/PPB loading screen: merchants can retain the default spinner or upload a GIF through one native Polaris drop zone, change its background color, and see both choices in the local Loading preview. Image Fit is disabled on the Loading surface because it does not affect that screen. Per-bundle loading animation controls are not exposed.
- Images & GIFs also owns one store-level FPB/PPB Slot Icon and a Slot Icon Presentation selector for every template. Centered badge replaces the native plus icon (recommended 96 x 96 px transparent square); Cover fills the responsive product slot; Fit contains an 800 x 800 px square image inside the responsive product slot.
- Tier Badge owns the global discount tier badge styling controls (Shape, Visibility, Text Color, and Background Color) applied across discounted tiers on the storefront.
- Component scenes use fixed logical 1280×1136 desktop and 390×844 mobile canvases that scale and center within the Admin panel. The isolated same-origin frame composes a neutral store header and FPB page or PPB product-detail context around the production widget. Product picker, Loading, Validation, and Upsell invoke the production renderer's corresponding state.
- The contextual inspector follows the selected edit area or non-default preview state. Editing a shared field preserves the current area instead of jumping to another region; the inspector heading names the active context.
- Unsaved design values are converted through the normalized storefront Design runtime and posted to the frame through a versioned same-origin protocol. The frame uses deterministic local media and fixture data, blocks navigation and cart submission, and disables persistence, analytics, and bundle fetching.
- Local Design controls and template previews remain available without a storefront-ready bundle. The separate Preview Bundle action is disabled while Design values are dirty or saving. Its Polaris modal lists only active/unlisted bundles with a valid FPB public number or PPB product handle, reserves a tab, posts the existing configure `/prepare-preview` action, and navigates to the signed FPB or tokenized PPB storefront URL.
- Relevant Expert Colour Control groups expose `Show Colour Guide` links to the five app-owned AVIF guide paths generated from tracked public PNG sources by CI/CD.
- Settings back actions await App Bridge Save Bar leave confirmation while unsaved changes exist; confirming Leave restores the last confirmed snapshot before the view changes.
- Language uses Polaris web components for locale chips, layout/section navigation, fields, variable guidance, and the contextual save flow. English is mandatory; removing another locale removes it from Landing Page, Product Page, and shared language roots.
- Language and Controls retain unsaved form state while the merchant stays; section changes await App Bridge leave confirmation and discard only after the merchant confirms Leave.
- Settings has one landing owner; selecting a subpage lazy-loads the workspace and returning home is guarded by the contextual save bar.
- Cart Messaging navigation from Controls to Language is also guarded by the contextual save bar.
- Design, Language, and Controls keep the contextual bar visible while saving; Save uses App Bridge's native loading state and the bar clears only after the matching server-confirmed snapshot.
- Configure and Settings save-bar owners hide their programmatic bar on unmount so route transitions and error boundaries cannot leak a stale busy bar into another Admin surface.

---

### 2.2a Settings Controls — `/app/settings/controls`

**Route file:** `app/routes/app/app.settings_.controls.tsx`

Dedicated Controls workspace:

```
Additional Configurations
├── Landing Page Layout
│   ├── Configuration
│   │   └── Show Compare-at Prices (default on)
│   ├── CSS & Scripts
│   └── Integrations
└── Product Page Layout
    ├── Configuration
    │   └── Show Compare-at Prices (default on)
    └── CSS & Scripts
```

- Reuses the Settings controls loader, action, persistence, save bar, and discard behavior.
- Configuration includes shared cart messaging for bundle items, original price, and discount display. Landing Page additionally owns checkout providers; Product Page owns its post-add redirect.
- CSS, scripts, selectors, and integrations save through stable field keys into the versioned storefront Controls contract. The deferred video-message player is not exposed as an Advanced tab.
- Enabled custom scripts are syntax-validated before save; each invalid field owns its Polaris error and persistence is skipped.
- Product Page cart-selector overrides are not exposed. Shopify storefront actions own cart updates and drawer opening; custom cart integration remains an explicit Landing Page integration.
- Deep-links layout, tab, and nested group through `layout`, `tab`, and `group` query parameters.
- Invalid query combinations resolve to the first valid visible tab and group.
- Back navigation returns to `/app/settings` after App Bridge save-bar leave confirmation.

---

### 2.2b Integrations — `/app/integrations`

**Route file:** `app/routes/app/app.integrations.tsx`

Compact Admin Integrations catalog:

```
Integrations Hub
├── App Bridge breadcrumb → previous page, with Dashboard fallback
├── App-owned back action → previous page, with Dashboard fallback
├── Request Integration → opens Crisp with an unsent prefilled request
├── Reviews
│   └── Judge.me → View Setup
├── Page Builders
│   ├── PageFly → View Setup
│   ├── GemPages → View Setup
│   └── Shogun → View Setup
└── Checkout
    ├── GoKwik → View Setup
    └── Shopflo → View Setup
```

Shopify Checkout and Theme Cart Drawer are configured in Settings and are not duplicated in this catalog.

Setup behavior:

- The static catalog paints immediately and does not own a route-level loading gate.
- Cards display Supported or Guided setup without claiming connection state.
- `View Setup` opens an app-owned Polaris modal populated from that integration's maintained `guideSummary` instructions.
- `Request Integration` opens Crisp and pre-fills the composer; the merchant must send the message.
- External competitor help URLs are intentionally not embedded in source code; sanitized evidence remains in `docs/competitor-analysis/18-eb-settings-integrations-replication-evidence.md`.
- Page-builder cards describe guided compatibility through the provider-neutral
  Theme App Extension block and HTML marker. Their setup actions remain inside
  the app and do not depend on an external placeholder domain.

---

### 2.3 Analytics — `/app/attribution`

**Route file:** `app/routes/app/app.attribution.tsx`
**Screenshot:** `screenshots/03-analytics.png`

```
Analytics Page (revamped — issue wpb-analytics-revamp-1)
├── Header: "Analytics" + App Bridge breadcrumb and app-owned back action
├── Top UTM Pixel Tracking banner (s-banner) — active vs not-enabled status
│   ├── Dismissal persists in sessionStorage for the current browser tab
│   └── Learn more modal → enable UTM tracking pixel
├── Toolbar: Compare-period chip · [Export CSV] · [Compare on/off] · Date range selector
├── Offer performance (Polaris section)
│   ├── Offer-policy selector persisted in the `offerPolicyId` URL query
│   ├── Safe rule-version, eligibility-source, and reached-tier context
│   └── Engaged → Added-to-Cart → Completed Orders → Revenue metrics
├── Custom UTM card → App Bridge contextual Save Bar with Save and Discard
├── Attribution backfill → Shopify success/error toast
│
├── ── Section 1 ── FUNNEL HERO ── (app/components/analytics/FunnelHero.tsx)
│   └── Engaged → Added-to-Cart → Checked Out → Revenue bars
│       with drop-off pills between steps (coral)
│
├── ── Section 2 ── 2-up grid ──
│   ├── Engagement Pulse (EngagementPulse.tsx)
│   │   ├── KPI: engaged sessions + delta vs prev period
│   │   ├── KPI: engaged → checkout %
│   │   └── 30-day area chart (teal)
│   └── Revenue Attribution (RevenueAttribution.tsx)
│       ├── KPI: bundle revenue + delta
│       ├── KPI: bundle AOV
│       └── 30-day area chart (gold)
│
├── ── Section 3 ── Bundle Performance Matrix (BundlePerformanceMatrix.tsx)
│   └── Sortable table: name | preset chip | engaged | orders | conv. | AOV | revenue
│       Click row → navigate to /app/bundles/full-page-bundle/configure/$bundleId
│
└── ── Section 4 ── 2-up grid ──
    ├── Live Activity Feed (LiveActivityFeed.tsx)
    │   └── Stream of last-25 BundleEngagement rows w/ relative-time
    └── Top Campaigns (TopCampaigns.tsx)
        └── Top-5 UTM campaigns w/ bar bg + revenue/orders
```

Responsive analytics behavior:

- The route owns a named `analytics-page` query container so toolbar, KPI, chart, and activity layouts respond to the embedded app width.
- Date, comparison, and export actions stack without page-level clipping; matrices preserve every value inside their labelled internal scroller.
- The lightweight route shell, title, and critical funnel heading render before deferred Analytics data.
- Pixel status resolves into the top native banner independently of the deferred dashboard.
- Dashboard JavaScript and CSS are owned by the eager route shell, so deferred Analytics data cannot reveal components before their styles.

**Visual tokens:** `app/components/analytics/shared/tokens.css`

- engagement teal `#0E7C7B`, revenue gold `#B08800`, warning amber `#A36F00`
- 44 px hero numerics · 11 px uppercase labels · 12 px radius · warm `#F5F2EE` bg

**Server helpers:** `app/lib/analytics/engagement-helpers.ts`

- `computeBundleFunnel`, `computeOfferFunnel`, `buildEngagementTrendSeries`, `buildBundlePerformanceMatrix`
- Pure-fn, unit-tested at `tests/unit/lib/engagement-helpers.test.ts`

---

### 2.3a Offer operations — `/app/offer-operations`

**Route file:** `app/routes/app/app.offer-operations.tsx`

```
Offer operations
├── Export offer policies
│   └── [Export CSV] → App Bridge-authenticated GET /app/offer-operations/export resource response
│       └── version 2 CSV attachment with one-time and recurring schedules
└── Validate and import
    ├── Polaris CSV drop zone (1 MiB and 500-row bounds)
    ├── [Validate CSV] → read-only row validation
    ├── [Apply valid changes] → atomic policy writes, then storefront sync
    └── Result summary → row errors and per-bundle storefront sync errors
```

The CSV addresses existing bundles by authenticated-shop bundle ID. Bundle
name, type, and status are export context only: import never creates, changes,
or publishes a bundle. Campaign tokens and token digests are excluded. Enabling
link-only delivery requires an existing active campaign link managed by the
bundle Configure action. Recurring rows must use the current Shopify store IANA
timezone; validation rejects a different or invalid timezone before any write.

---

### 2.4 Billing — `/app/billing`

**Route file:** `app/routes/app/app.billing.tsx`

The Billing parent shows the current plan, usage, features, and Shopify-hosted
plan management. Free merchants continue to the plans child route before
starting Shopify-hosted plan selection.

#### Billing Plans — `/app/billing/plans`

**Route file:** `app/routes/app/app.billing_.plans.tsx`
**Screenshot:** `screenshots/04-pricing.png`

```
Billing Plans Page
├── App Bridge breadcrumb + app-owned back action → previous page, Dashboard fallback
├── Subscription quota card (current usage)
│   └── Threshold prompt → Dismiss removes it for the current page mount
│
├── Plan cards: Free vs Growth
│   ├── [Button] "Choose Growth monthly" → Shopify-hosted App Pricing
│   └── [Button] "Choose Growth annual" → Shopify-hosted App Pricing
│
├── Feature comparison table
│
├── Value props section
│
├── FAQ accordion
│
└── Modal: Upgrade Confirmation (before billing redirect)
```

The App Bridge title renders immediately. A small Polaris spinner occupies the
body while subscription data resolves; the route does not render card-shaped
skeletons.

At phone widths, the FPB Bundle Setup sidebar becomes a native disclosure whose
summary shows the active section; selecting a parent or child section closes the
disclosure and preserves the existing configure state.

---

### 2.5 Bundle Configure — Full-Page Bundle

**Route file:** `app/routes/app/app.bundles.full-page-bundle.configure.$bundleId/route.tsx`
**URL:** `/app/bundles/full-page-bundle/configure/:bundleId`

When multiple publish conditions require attention, FPB and PPB show one
`Some items need your attention` warning with a `Manage` action. Manage opens
the shared Actions Needed modal, which lists each warning with its
original remediation action. A single active warning remains directly
actionable without the modal. PPB widget placement participates in this group
instead of rendering a separate critical banner. The subscriptions section uses the same
single-banner/modal behavior when compatibility and plan-validation warnings
coexist.

```
FPB Configure Page
├── Header: guarded App Bridge breadcrumb + guarded app-owned back action
├── Bundle name + status badge
│
├── Tabs
│   ├── Bundle Settings
│   │   ├── Bundle name / description

│   │       ├── Require the specific link uses the global configure SaveBar
│   │       └── Revoke immediately disables link-only delivery and invalidates the link
│   │       └── Offer Operations → priority, stop-lower-priority, always/one-time/recurring storefront schedule, live state, and next transition

│   │   ├── Progress Bar: Simple Bar / Step-Based Bar + Multi Language modal
│   │   └── Discount Messaging: per-rule Discount Text, one Success Message, Variables modal
│   │

FPB configure has no Shopify Page selector, Page slug editor, Page creation,
Page publishing, or Page-backed preview. The app embed is the only FPB theme
activation prerequisite and `/apps/product-bundles/wpb/{publicNumber}` is the
only FPB document URL. The number is assigned serially per shop; internal bundle
IDs remain confined to Admin routes, runtime data, and signed authorization.

Responsive configure behavior:

- FPB and PPB keep the full Bundle Product and Bundle Setup sidebar on wide screens.
- Tablet and phone containers show Bundle Product first and replace the long setup sidebar with a compact native disclosure labelled with the active parent or nested section.
- Selecting a section closes the mobile disclosure without changing save, dirty-state, or route adapter behavior.
- The readiness score renders eagerly. Wide screens use only the floating 64px square trigger; phones hide it and show a native `s-button` in the same action row as Preview Bundle. Both open the same anchored Polaris popover through `commandFor`.
- The non-blocking readiness popover contains only the checklist and readiness status, owns a bounded internal scroll region, and relies on Shopify for placement, Escape and outside dismissal, keyboard activation, and trigger-focus restoration. It never opens automatically on page load or repeats the score gauge inside the popover.
- The guided configure tour is desktop-only and is suppressed below 768px; mobile retains the readiness popover without the tour overlay.
- Guided-tour Step 2 highlights the desktop readiness control. Step 4 switches to Bundle Settings and highlights only Bundle Status for FPB and PPB.
- Configure multi-language workflows share one staged Polaris `s-modal`; Apply updates route-owned draft state and Cancel/Escape/backdrop-close discard edits.
- FPB and PPB expose curated visual help beside non-obvious setup, pricing, visibility, storefront, urgency, and subscription controls. Each info action opens the shared Polaris popover without changing configure state or activating the SaveBar.

### 2.6 Bundle Configure — Product-Page Bundle

**Route file:** `app/routes/app/app.bundles.product-page-bundle.configure.$bundleId/route.tsx`
**URL:** `/app/bundles/product-page-bundle/configure/:bundleId`

PPB uses the same SaveBar validation flow as FPB. Required fields and resource
selection are conditional on enabled persisted features; invalid Draft,
Unlisted, and Active saves are blocked before the route action and displayed as
inline critical field errors. Disabled branches are excluded. Subscription
drafts are validated only when enabled and use the same shared configuration
contract as FPB.

The shared Actions Needed modal described in FPB is also mounted by PPB when
multiple publish or subscription warnings are simultaneously active.

PPB preview checks the current app's `bundle-product-page` theme-extension
activation through Shopify's App API before recording or opening the preview.
The block must target the linked product's effective product template. Missing
placement opens the existing Shopify Theme Editor deep link; an unavailable
activation result fails closed and closes the reserved preview tab.

At phone widths, the PPB Bundle Setup sidebar uses the same active-section
disclosure behavior as FPB, including nested Step Setup and Bundle Visibility
items.

**Widget storefront features (as of v2.9.0):**

- Product details and the magnifying-glass image affordance are FPB-only. PPB
  product images and titles are informational; explicit Add, quantity, and
  variant controls own PPB product selection.
- PPB grouped products use each active category's Dropdown, Pills, Color
  swatches, or Image swatches selector. Color and image values come from
  Shopify `ProductOptionValue.swatch`; optional tooltips support desktop hover
  and keyboard focus,
  while mobile/coarse pointers retain a persistent selected-value label.
- PPB Horizontal Slots and Vertical Slots retain the bundle-picker modal opened
  from empty/replacement slots; this picker is distinct from product details.
- Step slot cards (empty/filled/locked states) with `addonLabel` for free gift tabs
- Quantity option pills (from `displayOptions.bundleQuantityOptions`)
- Gift message UI: textarea + optional From/To fields + char counter
- Progress bar (from `displayOptions.progressBar`)
- Gift message cart line item with `_bundle_id` + `_gift_message` properties
- Horizontal/Vertical Slots open a shared 85dvh picker with a fixed header and
  footer, internally scrolling two/four/five-column catalog, native grouped
  variant selectors, validation-owned quantity states, and an editable stacked
  product-details sheet. Product List/Grid retain their in-page card flow.

### 2.7 Billing — `/app/billing`

**Route file:** `app/routes/app/app.billing.tsx`

```
Billing Page
├── App Bridge breadcrumb + app-owned back action → previous page, Dashboard fallback
├── Success / Error banners (conditional on ?upgraded=true or error param)
├── Subscription quota card
├── Current plan display
└── [Button] "Upgrade" / "Manage plan" → Shopify-hosted App Pricing
```

**Managed-pricing return:** `/app/billing/return` — ignores redirect hints for
authorization, force-verifies the Partner API subscription, then redirects back.

---

## 3. User Flows

### Flow A: Auth

```
/ (landing)
  └── not authenticated → /auth/login
      └── Shopify login(request) validates shop + owns OAuth navigation
          └── /auth/callback
              └── Shopify authenticate.admin(request) completes auth
                  └── authenticated /app entry
                      ├── first entry in Admin tab → native splash
                      └── later entry in same tab  → /app/dashboard
```

Admin actions and directly requested Admin resource loaders authenticate before
request parsing, route validation, or method responses. Shopify-thrown auth and
redirect responses propagate unchanged; authenticated in-app redirects use the
`redirect` helper returned by `authenticate.admin(request)`.

### Flow B: Create & Configure Bundle

```
/app/dashboard
  └── [Create Bundle] → /app/bundles/create → select type + enter name → POST
      └── redirect → /app/bundles/{type}/configure/{bundleId}?mode=create
          └── first eligible create adds &first_load=true and opens the guided tour
          ├── Fill Bundle Settings tab
          ├── Add Steps tab
          ├── Set Pricing tab
          └── [Save] → [Sync Bundle tab → Sync Now]

/app/dashboard
  └── [Clone] → immediate POST (no confirmation)
      └── follow response redirectTo → /app/bundles/{type}/configure/{bundleId}?mode=create
```

On tablet and phone containers, configure section changes use the compact current-section disclosure.

### Flow B2: Edit from Shopify Bundled Products

```
Shopify Admin product or variant details
  └── Bundled products card → [Edit]
      └── /app/bundles/products/{product_id}
          └── authenticated shop-scoped lookup
              ├── FPB → /app/bundles/full-page-bundle/configure/{bundleId}
              └── PPB → /app/bundles/product-page-bundle/configure/{bundleId}
```

### Flow C: Design Customisation

```
/app/settings
  └── Click Design card → Settings -> Design panel opens
      ├── Existing Design sections and fields render in one inspector pane
      ├── Desktop → collapse or restore the inspector from its boundary chevron
      │   └── Canvas refits immediately without an animated size transition
      ├── Phone width → switch between Preview and Customize panes
      ├── Select preview-only bundle type, template, edit area, preview state, and desktop/mobile viewport
      │   ├── Edit area → return to Default, scroll to the region, and show its persistent focus outline
      │   └── Preview state → show the production picker/loading/validation/upsell state while retaining the edit area
      ├── Change setting → normalized Design CSS updates the isolated production renderer immediately (no persistence)
      ├── Inspector controls remain scoped to the active area or state
      ├── Preview blocks add-to-cart and form submission
      └── [Save] → Save Bar submits → toast confirmation
```

### Flow C2: Unsaved Navigation Protection

```
Dirty Admin form
  └── App nav, Settings back/section change, configure Back, or Design Control Panel
      └── App Bridge Save Bar leaveConfirmation()
          ├── Discard/leave → requested navigation continues
          └── Stay → current form and unsaved values remain
  └── Configure section change or Product editor intent
      └── Navigation/action is blocked and the existing save bar is surfaced
```

### Flow D: Billing Upgrade

```
/app/billing
  └── [Upgrade now] → /app/billing/plans
      └── [Choose Growth monthly / annual]
          └── Upgrade Confirmation Modal → confirm
              └── POST /app/billing/plans → configured Shopify-hosted plan URL
                  └── Merchant selects or approves plan → /app/billing/return?plan_handle=...
                      └── Partner API verification → /app/billing?upgraded=true
```

### Flow E: Bundle Checkout Pricing Safety

```
Storefront bundle add
  ├── parent-product PPB → Shopify-hosted schema-v3 snapshot + direct Storefront API hydration
  │   └── synchronized signed bundle/line tokens + component lines → Shopify cart pipeline
  └── FPB and service-dependent embed surfaces → online signed runtime token + component lines
      └── Cart Transform MERGE applies verified bundle pricing
          ├── success → transformed parent line proceeds to cart / checkout
          └── timeout, resource limit, or execution failure
              └── CartTransform blockOnFailure=true → cart / checkout error; unmodified pricing is not accepted
```

### Flow F: Reactive Checkout Bundle Offers

```
Checkout order summary → Bundle & Save
  └── group controls by published bundle and selected instance
      ├── read app-owned component policies and parent display configuration
      ├── gift check/uncheck → add/remove component cart line
      ├── add-on selection → add/replace component cart line
      └── quantity change → Shopify cart-line API with selection identifiers
          ├── Discount Function validates actual components against published rules
          └── cart API or inventory failure → restore prior line state
```
