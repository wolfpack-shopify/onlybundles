# Test Spec: Deployment General Sync
**Spec ID:** deployment-general-sync  **Created:** 2026-07-31

## Purpose
Replay the normal persisted storefront contract after deployment so each installed
shop receives shared setup once and then publishes all of its saved bundle values.

## Test Cases
### DeploymentGeneralSync
| # | Scenario | Input | Expected Output | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Disabled deployment sync | Flag absent or false | No database or Shopify calls | Default deployment remains mutation-free |
| 2 | Enabled deployment sync | Flag true with installed shops and saved bundles | Shared setup runs once per shop and data sync runs for every bundle | Uses persisted database rows |
| 3 | FPB add-ons enabled | Saved FPB personalization data enables add-ons | Add-on discount setup runs once for the shop | Mirrors FPB save follow-up |
| 4 | Multiple bundles in one shop | Two saved bundles for one shop | Shop preparation runs once; bundle data replay runs twice | Prevents repeated Cart Transform and runtime setup |
| 5 | Bundle sync failure | One replay throws | Failure is recorded and other bundles continue | Command exits non-zero from summary |
| 6 | Unsupported bundle type | Unknown saved bundle type | Bundle failure is recorded | No Shopify sync call |
| 7 | Single flag contract | Flag true or false | Parser returns only `enabled` | No auxiliary deployment sync variables |
| 8 | Dedicated PROD environment sync | `scripts/deployment-general-sync.prod.ts` with `.env.prod` | Uses PROD database URL, `STOREFRONT_PROXY_ROOT=/apps/product-bundles`, and PROD API key | Isolated from staging/SIT state |
| 9 | Dedicated SIT environment sync | `scripts/deployment-general-sync.sit.ts` with `.env.staging` | Uses SIT database URL, `STOREFRONT_PROXY_ROOT=/apps/product-bundles-sit`, and SIT API key | Isolated from production state |
| 10 | Obsolete FPB selection | Saved FPB has a missing or obsolete template selection | Persist canonical Standard selection before publication | No storefront compatibility alias |

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All listed test cases pass
- [ ] `npm run deployment:general-sync:prod` strictly loads `.env.prod` and syncs with `/apps/product-bundles`
- [ ] `npm run deployment:general-sync:sit` strictly loads `.env.staging` and syncs with `/apps/product-bundles-sit`
- [ ] `false` or an absent `WPB_DEPLOYMENT_GENERAL_SYNC` flag performs no scans or mutations
- [ ] Both scripts documented in `AGENTS.md` and internal docs
