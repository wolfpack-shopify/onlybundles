# Deployment General Sync

Deployment commands run environment-specific general sync after Shopify deploy:
- Production: `npm run deployment:general-sync:prod` (loads `.env.prod`, connects to production database, enforces PROD proxy root `/apps/product-bundles` and validates PROD client ID `a383172f42c2ab283901a663d485a03d`).
- SIT / Staging: `npm run deployment:general-sync:sit` (loads `.env.staging`, connects to SIT database, enforces SIT proxy root `/apps/product-bundles-sit` and validates SIT client ID `63077bb0483a6ce08a2d6139b14d170b`).

The commands ensure current metafield definitions are installed before saved bundle values
are replayed. The command is a no-op unless:

```bash
WPB_DEPLOYMENT_GENERAL_SYNC=true
```

When enabled, each installed shop is the orchestration unit. Shared Shopify setup
is performed once per shop; saved bundle values are then replayed as child work:

1. Lists installed shops and their saved FPB and PPB bundle rows.
2. Acquires each shop's compliant offline Admin client.
3. Ensures the current variant metafield definitions.
4. Completes Cart Transform setup and ensures the shop-level PPB Storefront
   token, environment-correct app-proxy root, FPB runtime, controls/language
   runtime, generated Design CSS metafields, and theme colors once for the shop.
5. Checks saved variant references with Admin GraphQL `nodes`, in batches of
   at most 250 IDs, then removes confirmed missing or malformed references
   through the existing persistence contract. Storefront availability is not
   evidence that a variant has been deleted. Access errors, incomplete responses,
   unexpected node identities, and persistence failures stop that bundle's sync.
6. Calls `syncBundleStorefrontDataNow(... reason: "sync_bundle")` for each saved
   bundle after remediation. It reloads the complete bundle graph from Prisma and
   writes current app-owned product/variant metafield values without repeating
   shop-level setup. Missing or obsolete FPB template identifiers are persisted
   as the canonical Standard selection before publication; storefront aliases are
   not used. Publishing before remediation would leave Shopify using stale state.
7. Ensures the automatic add-on discount once for every shop with an enabled
   saved FPB add-on configuration.
8. Ensures the role-tagged subscription initial-order automatic discount once
   for every shop with an enabled saved FPB or PPB subscription configuration.
   This node uses `recurringCycleLimit=1`.
9. Ensures the separate recurring subscription discount for shops with at least
   one enabled recurring bundle configuration. This node uses
   `recurringCycleLimit=0`, and the Function accepts it only when the signed
   bundle selection also authorizes recurring bundle pricing.

Any shop or bundle failure marks that shop failed and makes the command exit
non-zero. Sibling bundles and other shops continue so the summary preserves
bundle-level diagnostics. This is the only deployment sync workflow and
`WPB_DEPLOYMENT_GENERAL_SYNC` is its only flag.

Update the general-sync script, service, and tests only when the Prisma schema
or metafield definition or value contract changes. Do not add placeholder
metaobject or compatibility hooks without a persisted contract and a caller.

Variant existence uses Shopify’s [Admin nodes query](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/nodes), through the shop’s existing authenticated Admin client.

## Coordinated authorization cutover

The canonical parent writer now reconciles Shopify-owned scheduled automatic
discounts before publishing the current `{revision, pricingMode}` policy record
for either bundle type. `scheduled_initial` owns the first billing cycle;
`scheduled_recurring` owns recurring subscription cycles when configured. Shopify
owns dates, combinations and automatic-discount capacity. No discount IDs are
mirrored into new database columns, and native API/readback failures fail sync.

Deploy the matching Functions and server writer together, then use normal Bundle
Sync or this existing general-sync workflow. The new Function requires
`componentQuantities` inside `price_adjustment` and current authorization records;
it does not read legacy values as a fallback. Public component quantities and
large display pricing remain separate published metafields. An unsynchronized
existing bundle can lose authorization until sync succeeds. Newly onboarded stores
use this same canonical writer; capacity, access and invalid configuration failures
must surface instead of marking the bundle synchronized.
