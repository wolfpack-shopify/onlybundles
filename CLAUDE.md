# Claude Code Development Guidelines

## Core Operating Principles

1. **Ask, do not assume.** If something is unclear, ask before writing a single line. No silent guesses about intent, architecture, or requirements.
2. **Simplest solution first.** Implement the simplest thing that could work. No abstractions or flexibility you did not explicitly request.
3. **Do not touch unrelated code.** If a file or function is not part of the current task, do not modify it even if you think it could be improved.
4. **Flag uncertainty explicitly.** If you are not confident about an approach or technical detail, say so before proceeding. Confidence without certainty causes damage.

---

## Architecture and Gotcha Documentation

Do not create issue files or run the feature pipeline by default. They are overhead for normal repo work.

Document only durable knowledge:
- **Core architecture changes** — update the relevant note in `internal docs/` and link it from `internal docs/index.md`.
- **Gotcha moments** — document non-obvious debugging findings, Shopify/API behavior, build constraints, deployment quirks, or data-model facts that will matter again.
- **Routine edits** — do not create process docs for ordinary implementation progress, cosmetic changes, or one-off fixes.

### Documentation Metadata Standard

Every new Markdown documentation file, and every existing Markdown documentation file that receives a material documentation update, must begin with YAML frontmatter using exactly these fields in this order:

```yaml
---
schema_version: 1
id: <stable-kebab-case-id>
title: <document-title>
type: <document-type>
status: <document-status>
summary: <one-sentence-summary>
last_audited: YYYY-MM-DD
owners:
  - <owner>
domains:
  - <domain>
systems:
  - <system>
source_paths:
  - <source-path>
related_docs:
  - <related-document-path>
tags:
  - <tag>
keywords:
  - <search-keyword>
---
```

Do not omit, rename, reorder, or add metadata fields unless the user explicitly changes this standard. Use empty YAML lists (`[]`) when a list field has no values. Keep `id` stable across renames and moves, and update `last_audited` whenever the document is materially verified or revised.

---

## 🧪 Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Write tests **before** implementation. Cycle: Red → Green → Refactor.

### Test file locations
```
apps/OnlyBundles-app/tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── lib/          ← helpers, utilities
│   ├── services/     ← server services
│   ├── routes/       ← route action/loader functions
│   └── extensions/   ← cart transform, checkout UI
├── integration/      ← multi-layer flows
└── e2e/              ← full request lifecycle
```
File naming: `{module-name}.test.ts`

### What must be tested
- Every exported function in `apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/lib/`
- Every auth guard path (authorized, unauthorized, missing env var)
- Every route `action` and `loader` — happy path + error cases
- Any function with conditional branching or security logic

```bash
npm test | npm run test:unit | npm run test:watch | npm run test:coverage
```

TDD does NOT apply to: one-line config changes, CSS-only changes, docs changes, route annotation comments.

### 🚫 No UI Styling or Placement Unit Tests

**A unit test must verify a component's BEHAVIOUR, never its CSS, class names, or where it sits on the screen.** These tests are useless: they fail on harmless cosmetic refactors, never catch real bugs, and ossify implementation details.

**Banned patterns — do not write, and remove on sight:**
- For storefront templates, implement styling changes (dividers, borders, spacing, alignment, spacing/padding, height/width-related presentation) in CSS files, not through JavaScript DOM injection or runtime HTML composition.
- Reading a `.css` / `.module.css` file with `fs.readFileSync(...)` and asserting on CSS properties (`width:`, `height:`, `padding:`, `margin:`, `grid-template-columns`, `font-size:`, `color:`, `background:`, `border-radius:`, etc.).
- Reading a `.tsx` / `.jsx` / `.js` source file and asserting that a CSS class name is present (`expect(source).toContain("styles.someClass")` or `expect(source).toContain('className="...')`).
- Asserting on element order via `indexOf` comparisons on source text (`expect(source.indexOf("A")).toBeLessThan(source.indexOf("B"))`) to verify "X renders before Y on screen".
- Reading widget JS sources to grep for CSS selectors, layout markers, or visual contracts.
- "Pixel parity" / "layout contract" / "UI contract" tests that snapshot how a component LOOKS in source code.

**What you SHOULD test:**
- Pure functions: inputs → outputs. (A function whose JOB is to produce CSS as a string — e.g. a CSS generator — is fair game, because its OUTPUT is the behaviour.)
- Conditional rendering / branching logic: render with prop X, assert a returned value or side effect — NOT a class name.
- Data flow: action dispatched → state changed → API called with the right shape.
- Route action/loader behaviour: happy path + error cases.
- Auth guards, validation, business rules.

**File-name red flags that almost always indicate a styling test:** `*-layout.test.ts`, `*-ui-contract.test.ts`, `*-parity-contract.test.ts`, `*-shell-layout.test.ts`, `*-admin-layout.test.ts`. New files matching these patterns are almost always wrong; treat them as a code smell during review.

If you need to verify visual parity with a competitor or design, do it with Chrome DevTools MCP / visual diff — not with a Jest test that greps a CSS file.

### Test Spec Files — Mandatory in TDD Sessions

Create `apps/OnlyBundles-app/test-spec/{module-name}.spec.md` alongside every Shopify-app TDD session.

```markdown
# Test Spec: {Module / Feature Name}
**Spec ID:** {module-name}  **Created:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Purpose
## Test Cases
### {TestSuiteName}
| # | Scenario | Input | Expected Output | Notes |
## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All listed test cases pass
```

---

## 🚫 Strict Rules

1. ❌ NEVER run `shopify app deploy` autonomously — see Shopify Deploy Rule
2. ✅ Write tests BEFORE implementation for all new code
3. ✅ Run linter on modified files BEFORE every commit — see Lint Before Commit
4. ❌ NO backwards-compatibility shims or migration hacks — see No Backwards Compatibility Rule
5. ✅ CREATE a test spec file in `apps/OnlyBundles-app/test-spec/` for every Shopify-app TDD session
6. ❌ NO hardcoded fallback UI copy strings — never fabricate merchant-facing marketing copy
7. ❌ NO unnecessary API fallback chains — use the single correct source per official docs
8. ❌ NEVER commit Chrome DevTools investigation screenshots
9. ❌ NO competitor references in code (`eb`, `skai`, `skailama`, `easybundles`) — docs only
10. ❌ NO unit tests that assert on CSS, class names, or element placement — see No UI Styling or Placement Unit Tests rule

---

## 📐 Responsive Storefront CSS Rule

Storefront template CSS must be responsive and content-driven. Do not overfit a template to one store, fixture, viewport, or competitor screenshot by copying precise captured pixel values into layout rules.

Use `clamp()`, `minmax()`, `%`, `fr`, viewport/container units, intrinsic sizing, and named design tokens for shell widths, grid tracks, card heights, sidebars, mobile trays, and spacing. Exact fixed values are acceptable only for true primitives such as hairline borders, icons, control hit targets, or documented Shopify/theme limits.

When visual parity requires measured evidence, keep exact measurements in docs or notes as evidence, then translate them into responsive CSS. Avoid `!important`; fix ownership, scope, or selector specificity instead.

---

## 🧩 Polaris Web Components First Rule

Use Polaris web components (`s-*`) for **all** Admin-embedded app UI. Fall back to custom HTML only when no Polaris component exists.

**Components (polaris-app-home surface):**
- Actions: `s-button`, `s-button-group`, `s-link`, `s-menu`
- Forms: `s-checkbox`, `s-select`, `s-text-field`, `s-text-area`, `s-switch`, `s-number-field`, `s-search-field`, `s-drop-zone`
- Feedback: `s-badge`, `s-banner`, `s-spinner`
- Layout: `s-box`, `s-stack`, `s-grid`, `s-section`, `s-divider`
- Typography: `s-heading`, `s-text`, `s-paragraph`
- Media: `s-icon`, `s-thumbnail`, `s-image`, `s-avatar`
- Overlays: `s-modal`, `s-popover`
- Interactive: `s-clickable`, `s-clickable-chip`, `s-chip`

**Icon names:** `plus`, `delete`, `view`, `upload`, `globe`, `search`, `filter`, `edit`, `info`, `check`, `x`, `duplicate`, `menu-horizontal`, `alert-triangle`, `clock`, `note`, `product`, `arrow-left`, `arrow-right`

**Acceptable custom HTML exceptions:** tab navigation, step chip/pill patterns, keyframe animations, fixed-position overlays, complex grids not achievable with `s-grid`.

Check availability: `mcp__shopify-dev-mcp__learn_shopify_api(api: "polaris-app-home")`

---

## 🔄 No Backwards Compatibility Rule

Do not consider writing any fallbacks to support legacy code. Ignore any legacy code and strive to update/remove any legacy code when you encounter it.

**NEVER add backwards-compatibility code.** The app has a "Sync Bundle" feature — merchants re-sync to pick up new defaults.

**Banned patterns:**
- Fallback shims reading old JSON blob fields when new direct columns exist
- Deprecated field mappings in `extractGeneralSettings` / `buildSettingsData`
- Version-detection code that adjusts behavior for old data
- `if (legacyField) use(legacyField) else use(newField)` patterns

**Correct approach:** Add new Prisma columns with sensible defaults. Drop old JSON blob keys. Bump `WIDGET_VERSION` and show a sync prompt banner for breaking changes.

---

## 🔍 Lint Before Commit Rule

```bash
npx eslint --max-warnings 9999 <file1> <file2> ...
# or full project:
npm run lint -- --max-warnings 9999
```

Zero ESLint errors required. Warnings acceptable (pre-existing ~6500 warnings in project). Fix new errors you introduced; leave pre-existing warnings.

---

## 🗺️ App Navigation Map

**MANDATORY:** Update `docs/app-nav-map/APP_NAVIGATION_MAP.md` whenever you:
- Add/rename/remove a route, page, modal, or tab
- Add a new Settings subpage, sidebar section, or configuration tab
- Add/change a user flow or add relevant API routes

---

## 🚢 Shopify Deploy Rule

**NEVER run `shopify app deploy` autonomously.** Always stop and prompt:

```
ACTION REQUIRED — Manual deploy needed.
Run in your terminal:
  npm run deploy:prod   ← PROD (wolfpack-product-bundles-4)
  npm run deploy:sit    ← SIT  (wolfpack-product-bundles-sit)
Reason: [brief explanation]
Let me know once it completes.
```

The root npm scripts delegate deployment to `apps/OnlyBundles-app` — never call `shopify app deploy` directly.

## 🔄 Deployment General Sync Rule

Deployment scripts run `npm run deployment:general-sync` after Shopify deploy.
It is disabled by default and accepts one primary true/false flag:

```bash
WPB_DEPLOYMENT_GENERAL_SYNC=true
```

When true, it reads installed shops and saved bundles from Prisma, ensures
current metafield definitions, replays the normal save-time storefront sync,
attempts registered metaobject value sync, and ensures FPB add-on discounts.
Update `apps/OnlyBundles-app/scripts/deployment-general-sync.ts` and its service/tests **only when**
the Prisma schema changes or the app's metafield/metaobject definitions or
value-writing contracts change. Do not edit it for routine feature, UI, or
deployment changes.

## ⚠️ Cart Transform Repair Rule

`npm run cart-transform:repair` runs an app-context Cart Transform repair for installed shops. It is disabled by default and accepts only these mode flags:

```bash
WPB_CART_TRANSFORM_REPAIR_DRY_RUN=true
WPB_CART_TRANSFORM_REPAIR_APPLY=true
```

Never set both flags. Dry-run scans installed shops without mutating Shopify. Apply mode runs `CartTransformService.completeSetup` through the app's offline Admin context for every installed shop.

**NEVER run repair apply mode autonomously.** Stop and ask for explicit user approval first. Warn the user that production apply mode can create or replace CartTransform objects and overwrite the `$app.runtime_token_secret` owner metafield across live merchant shops.

---

## 🧪 Shopify Dev Environment Rule

**NEVER run `npm run dev` autonomously.** The development server will always be provided by the user.

If asked or prompted about starting the dev environment, provide instructions only. Tell the user to start the SIT app config explicitly with the SIT TOML, not the standard PROD config:

```bash
npm run dev:sit
```

Do not run dev against `apps/OnlyBundles-app/shopify.web.toml` / the production Shopify app configuration.

---

## 🔐 Shopify Expiring Offline Token Rule

Public apps must use Shopify expiring offline access tokens. Before changing auth, session storage, background Admin API clients, app-proxy Admin API callers, or install/reauthorization code, check the official Shopify offline token docs:
`https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/authentication-authorization/access-tokens/offline-access-tokens`

Required checks:
- Offline token acquisition and migration requests to `/admin/oauth/access_token` must include `expiring=1`.
- Persist `expires`, `refreshToken`, and `refreshTokenExpiresAt` for offline sessions.
- Session storage must never return a non-expiring offline session to Admin API callers. Legacy offline rows with no refresh token must be migrated first, or withheld if migration fails.
- Background Admin API work must use `unauthenticated.admin(shopDomain)` or `getOfflineSessionForShop(...)`; do not read `Session.accessToken` directly from Prisma.
- Token refresh must use `grant_type=refresh_token` and persist the newly returned access token, refresh token, and expiration metadata.
- Add or update focused behavior tests for any auth/session change that could reintroduce non-expiring offline tokens.

---

## 🧪 Admin LCP Debug Bridge Rule

For major Admin UI changes, recreate and use the temporary Admin LCP debug bridge in dev/SIT to optimize route-level LCP before relying on Shopify field data.

Reference implementation and notes:
- Diagnostics runtime: `apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/lib/admin-web-vitals-diagnostics.client.ts`
- Operating doc: `internal docs/Operations/Admin Performance.md`

Expected dev workflow:
1. Enable debug mode with `?wpbWebVitalsDebug=1` on the embedded Shopify Admin app URL.
2. Use the iframe `postMessage` bridge to read route-local samples when cross-origin iframe access blocks direct inspection.
3. Clear samples before each fresh route pass.
4. Measure the exact route and LCP candidate after every major Admin UI change.
5. Treat the bridge as dev/SIT diagnostic tooling only; Shopify Admin field metrics remain the source of truth for Built for Shopify.

Do not keep the bridge in committed runtime code after the measurement cycle. If the bridge has been removed after a prior optimization cycle, recreate it temporarily from the documented pattern before the next major Admin UI performance pass, then remove it again before shipping. Do not recreate app-owned server-side Web Vitals persistence or `/api/web-vitals` telemetry.

---

## 🔧 Widget Bundle Build Process

**ALWAYS build after modifying these source files:**

Widget sources → `npm run build:widgets`:
- `apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/assets/bundle-widget-components.js`
- `apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/assets/bundle-modal-component.js`
- `apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/assets/bundle-widget-full-page.js`
- `apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/assets/bundle-widget-product-page.js`

SDK sources → `npm run build:sdk`:
- `apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/assets/sdk/` (state.js, events.js, config-loader.js, cart.js, validate-bundle.js, get-display-price.js, debug.js, wolfpack-bundles.js)
- Output: `apps/OnlyBundles-app/extensions/bundle-builder/assets/wolfpack-bundles-sdk.js`

**Build commands:**
```bash
npm run build:widgets           # all widget JavaScript bundles
npm run build:widgets:full-page
npm run build:widgets:product-page
npm run build:sdk
```

**Raw widget JS syntax check:** after editing raw storefront widget JS, run `node --check <file>` before commit.

Examples:
```bash
node --check apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/assets/bundle-widget-full-page.js
node --check apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/assets/bundle-widget-product-page.js
node --check apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/assets/bundle-modal-component.js
node --check apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/assets/bundle-widget-components.js
```

**Forgetting to build = changes won't appear in the storefront.**

---

## 🎨 CSS Asset Build

Always edit raw source CSS files, then assemble the deployable extension assets:

Raw sources:
- `apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/assets/widgets/full-page-css/bundle-widget-full-page.css`
- `apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/assets/widgets/product-page-css/bundle-widget.css`

Generated output (deploy target):
- `apps/OnlyBundles-app/extensions/bundle-builder/assets/bundle-widget-full-page.css`
- `apps/OnlyBundles-app/extensions/bundle-builder/assets/bundle-widget.css`

| Change type | Command |
|---|---|
| JS bundle changes | `npm run build:widgets` |
| CSS-only changes | `npm run build:css` |
| Both CSS and JS | `npm run build:widgets && npm run build:css` |

Shopify's CDN minifies valid CSS at delivery time. The repository build only
resolves local CSS imports into readable theme-extension assets.

---

## 🔢 Widget Version Rule

Increment `WIDGET_VERSION` in `apps/OnlyBundles-app/scripts/build-storefront.mjs` before every widget deploy.

| Change type | Version bump |
|---|---|
| Bug fix | PATCH x.y.Z |
| New feature (backwards-compatible) | MINOR x.Y.z |
| Breaking change / redesign | MAJOR X.y.z |

**Steps before every widget deploy:**
1. Increment `WIDGET_VERSION`
2. `npm run build:widgets`
3. `npm run build:css`
4. Commit source + bundled files
5. Run `npm run deploy:prod` or `npm run deploy:sit`
6. Wait 2–10 min for Shopify CDN cache propagation

Verify live version: `console.log(window.__BUNDLE_WIDGET_VERSION__)` in DevTools console.

Shopify CDN cache-busting: the `?v=HASH` param on `asset_url` only changes on `shopify app deploy`. Custom query params are NOT on the CDN allowlist.

Storefront asset strategy: theme/app-extension Liquid must load storefront JS/CSS with Shopify `asset_url`. Do not use `/apps/product-bundles/assets/...` as the production storefront JS/CSS loading path; app proxy is for signed API/data routes only.

---

## 🚨 Do Not Touch — Bundle Config Loading (FPB Widget)

**NEVER modify the bundle config loading priority order in `bundle-widget-full-page.js`.**

Two-stage load strategy:
1. **Stage 1 — Metafield cache (primary):** Liquid block writes config into `data-bundle-config` attribute. Widget reads on init — zero network, instant first paint.
2. **Stage 2 — Proxy API fallback:** If metafield absent/empty/malformed, falls back to `GET /apps/product-bundles/api/bundle/{id}.json` with single retry after 3s for `503`/`504` (Render cold-starts).

**Rules:**
- ❌ Do NOT remove or reorder the `data-bundle-config` check — must run before proxy fetch
- ❌ Do NOT remove `503`/`504` retry logic — Render cold-starts are 3–10s
- ❌ Do NOT add a third source between Stage 1 and Stage 2
- ✅ If bundle config structure changes, update server writer AND widget parser together

**Relevant files:**
- Widget: `apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/assets/bundle-widget-full-page.js` — `loadBundleConfig()` (~line 325)
- Liquid: `apps/OnlyBundles-app/extensions/bundle-builder/blocks/bundle-full-page.liquid` — `data-bundle-config`
- Server: `apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/services/bundles/metafield-sync/bundle-config-metafield.server.ts`

---

## 🔐 Test Store Access

- Store: `wolfpack-store-test-1.myshopify.com`
- Default storefront password: `1`

## 🧭 Chrome DevTools App Verification

Access embedded app via Shopify Admin URL:
```
https://admin.shopify.com/store/wolfpack-store-test-1/apps/wolfpack-product-bundles-sit/app/...
```
Do NOT use Cloudflare tunnel URLs directly — they redirect to `/auth/login`.

---

## 🐙 GitHub Tasks — Always Use `gh` CLI

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Create PR | `gh pr create` |
| View PRs | `gh pr list` / `gh pr view` |
| Merge PR | `gh pr merge` |
| Create issue | `gh issue create` |
| View issues | `gh issue list` / `gh issue view` |
| Check CI | `gh run list` / `gh run view` |
| Remote branches | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches` |
| Commit SHA | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{ref}` |
| Comment | `gh pr comment` / `gh issue comment` |

## graphify

Knowledge graph at `graphify-out/`, internal docs vault at `internal docs/`.

### Mandatory Search Order

1. **`internal docs/`** — start here for Cart Transform, Pricing, DB schema, Shopify API limits, widget architecture, deployment.
2. **`graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md`** — god nodes and community structure.
3. **`graphify-out/wiki/`** — node-level detail.
4. **Raw source files** — ONLY when vault and graph don't cover the detail.

❌ Do NOT open raw `.ts`/`.js`/`.liquid`/`.prisma` files speculatively.

### Keeping the Vault Current

If you learn something about Shopify API behaviour, gotchas, data model details, or build rules that's NOT in `internal docs/` → write/update the note and add link in `internal docs/index.md`.

### Graph-Assisted Debugging & RCA

1. Find affected node's community in `GRAPH_REPORT.md`.
2. Run `graphify path "NodeA" "NodeB"` to trace relationship chains.
3. Check **Surprising Connections** and **Hyperedges** sections.

```bash
graphify path "ComponentA" "ComponentB"
graphify query "what depends on X?"
```

### Impact Analysis — Mandatory Before Every Change

1. Identify god nodes in `GRAPH_REPORT.md` — changes touching these require extra care.
2. Find all nodes depending on what you're changing.
3. Document blast radius in **commit message body** and **PR description**:

```
[issue-id] type: short description

Impact: touches <CommunityName>, depends on <GodNode>
Affected: <file1>, <file2>
Tested by: <test-file(s)>
```

PR Impact Analysis section:
```markdown
## Impact Analysis
- **Communities touched**: [list]
- **God nodes affected**: [list]
- **Downstream risk**: [what could break]
- **Test coverage**: [test files]
```

### Keeping the Graph Current

After modifying code files, run:
```bash
npm run graphify:rebuild
```

## 🔗 EB Help Links — Read Before Every Implementation

Before implementing any EB feature, click and read **every** "How to setup" and "Learn More" link visible on any relevant card or feature in the EB app.

**Why:** These links contain precise setup instructions, field explanations, and behavior details that are not visible from the UI alone. Skipping them means implementing based on guesswork.

**Rules:**
- ✅ Click every help/learn-more link on the relevant card or feature page before writing any code
- ✅ If the link opens a **popup** (overlay/modal inside the EB app) — read the full popup content before dismissing
- ✅ If the link opens a **new tab** (external website or docs page) — fetch and read the full page content via `WebFetch`
- ❌ Do NOT start implementation until all available help links for that feature have been read
- ❌ Do NOT assume the UI alone is sufficient — help content routinely reveals hidden fields, constraints, and sequencing requirements

**Workflow:**
1. Navigate to the relevant EB card/page in Chrome DevTools MCP
2. `take_snapshot()` — identify all "How to setup", "Learn More", "?" or similar link text
3. Click each link; screenshot and read popup content OR `WebFetch` the opened URL
4. Document any new facts discovered in `internal docs/EB Implementation Reference.md`
5. Only then proceed to implementation

---

## 🎯 EB Implementation Reference — Grounded Truth for Porting

When implementing any feature that mirrors EB behaviour — step/category data shapes, admin API payloads, template IDs, storefront runtime globals, cart add format, box selection enforcement, or text config — **consult `internal docs/EB Implementation Reference.md` first.**

This doc is the distilled, topic-organized reference captured from a live authenticated EB investigation. Do NOT guess EB's data shapes — they are fully documented there.

### What it covers

| Topic | What's documented |
|---|---|
| Admin API endpoints | All FPB + PPB create/update/save paths |
| FPB step/category payload | Complete JSON shape including `categoryType`, product ID arrays, collection GIDs |
| PPB step/category payload | Complete JSON shape including `conditions`, `displayVariantsAsIndividualProducts`, `displayVariantsAsSwatches` |
| Discount configuration | `discountConfiguration` + compact `metafieldData.discount` mirror |
| Default/preselected products | `defaultProductsData` full shape |
| Template system | FPB two-field (`bundleDesignTemplate` + `bundleDesignPresetId`) — all 4 presets confirmed; PPB two-field (`bundleDesignTemplate` + `templateId`) — all 4 templates confirmed |
| Storefront globals | FPB `window.gbb.*` + `stepsConfigurationData`; PPB `window.gbbMix.*` + `mixAndMatchBundleSettings` (25+ fields) |
| Cart add format | FPB JSON + PPB multipart; `_wolfpackProductBundle:OfferId` format; `bundle_details` metafield accumulation |
| Box selection | `gbbBoxSelection.state` schema; ATC enforcement logic (decompiled); DOM structure |
| Text config | `bundleTextConfig.bundleSummary.{title,subTitle}` — confirmed only two fields |
| Collection pagination | Batch `nodes(ids:[...])` architecture — NOT cursor-based |
| Wolfpack DB alignment | Field-by-field mapping from EB payload → Wolfpack model |

### Mandatory search order for EB porting questions

1. `internal docs/EB Implementation Reference.md` — confirmed facts, exact JSON shapes
2. `docs/competitor-analysis/16-eb-full-data-flow-investigation.md` — full evidence record with raw payloads, decompiled JS, and DOM captures
3. Only then: live DevTools investigation if the reference doc has a gap

❌ Do NOT assume or fabricate EB data shapes — they are documented.
❌ Do NOT re-investigate facts already in the reference doc.

## 📱 Storefront UI Audit — Desktop + Mobile

When auditing storefront UI, test **both viewports**:
1. Desktop screenshot (1280×800+)
2. Mobile screenshot (emulate iPhone 14, 390×844)
3. Report findings for both

Before every storefront UI review after source, build, or deploy changes, empty/bypass browser cache and hard reload the storefront in Chrome (Chrome DevTools MCP: `navigate_page` reload with `ignoreCache: true`; also clear Cache Storage via `caches.keys()` when available). Do not trust a normal refresh for storefront parity checks.

Before testing any implemented storefront change in Chrome, always refresh the relevant storefront tab first, then verify the changed behaviour or appearance. Do not test against an already-open tab without refreshing after the implementation/build step.

Required for: "audit the storefront", "check the UI", post-deploy verification, appearance bug reports.

---

## 🔬 Competitor Parity Audit Rule

For any "parity", "compare", "match competitor" request — conduct a full audit before writing code.

**Parity means:** pixel-level placement, visual hierarchy, spacing (measured via `getComputedStyle`), UX interactions, edge cases.

**Audit workflow:**
1. Open competitor in Chrome DevTools MCP, take full-page screenshot
2. Use `take_snapshot` for DOM structure, `evaluate_script` for computed styles
3. Interact (click, hover, toggle) and screenshot each state
4. If CORS blocks `evaluate_script` — use `take_snapshot` + keyboard interactions
5. Document every gap (placement, size, color, spacing, behavior)
6. Implement only after audit is complete

❌ Do NOT estimate spacing — measure it. ❌ Do NOT skip mobile for storefront parity. ❌ Do NOT implement partial parity.

---

## 🖱️ Chrome DevTools — Shopify Admin Iframe Interaction

The Shopify Admin embeds the app in a cross-origin OOPIF — `contentDocument` is null from the outer page.

### PRIMARY METHOD — Keyboard Tab Navigation

Try Tab navigation BEFORE `evaluate_script`. The CDP accessibility tree traverses cross-origin iframes.

1. `take_snapshot()` — find interactive elements (button, textbox, checkbox) inside iframe
2. `click(uid: "...")` — click a safe interactive element to bring focus into iframe
3. `press_key(key: "Tab")` / `press_key(key: "Shift+Tab")` — navigate to target
4. `press_key(key: "Enter")` (buttons/links) or `press_key(key: "Space")` (checkboxes/toggles) — activate
5. `take_screenshot()` — verify result

If nav items are `StaticText` nodes (no ARIA role), use arrow keys or fall back to CDP target method.

### FALLBACK — `evaluate_script` via CDP target

Use when the app's own iframe registers as a separate CDP target in `list_pages`.

1. `list_pages()` — find iframe's pageId
2. `select_page(pageId: "...")` — switch to iframe target
3. `evaluate_script(script: "document.querySelector('...').click()")` — interact
4. `take_screenshot()` — verify
5. `select_page(pageId: "<admin-page-id>")` — switch back

Always `select_page` to the **iframe target** before `evaluate_script`. For third-party CORS-blocked iframes, use Tab navigation instead.
