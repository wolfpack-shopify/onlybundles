# Storefront Outage Resilience

The parent-product PPB block has no runtime dependency on Wolfpack web-service
availability. Shopify serves the extension Liquid, versioned JS/CSS assets, and
app-owned metafields. The browser reads the complete schema-v3 bundle snapshot
from the parent variant and hydrates current product, variant, price, market,
and inventory data directly from Shopify Storefront API `2026-07` with the
shop's public Storefront access token.

This does not assume Shopify caches an app-proxy response. The resilient path
removes the app proxy from parent-product PPB initialization, product hydration,
settings hydration, cart attribution, and purchase authorization. Automatic and
page-builder PPB surfaces still use their signed app-proxy lookup to select a
bundle, but the app-embed marker supplies Shopify-hosted runtime, Design CSS,
and currency context before their shared PPB widget starts. FPB retains its
documented app-proxy contracts.

## Synchronized Shopify State

- Parent variant `$app.bundle_ui_config`: complete schema-v3 PPB configuration,
  including materialized collection membership and signed v2 authorization.
- Shop `$app.ppb_storefront_runtime`: public Storefront endpoint contract,
  Product Page controls, and locale-keyed language data.
- Shop `$app.ppb_storefront_css`: sanitized Design CSS, including resolved Shop
  Brand colors.
- Shop `$app.ppb_policy_revisions`: compact map of bundle ID to current policy
  revision, consumed directly by Shopify Functions.

The bundle snapshot and shop revision map are submitted in one atomic
`metafieldsSet` mutation. Save rejects an
oversized snapshot before writing, so Shopify retains the last known-good state.
Settings saves similarly persist first and report a synchronization failure
without replacing the last known-good Shopify runtime.

## Purchase Integrity

The synchronized snapshot contains one HMAC-signed bundle token and bounded
line tokens. Each line token binds shop, bundle, policy revision, product or
variant, semantic role, aggregate maximum quantity, and maximum add-on
percentage. Cart Transform and Discount Functions validate signatures and the
current shop policy revision. They reject stale, altered, mismatched, or
split-line over-quantity submissions. Cart Transform uses
`blockOnFailure=false`, so a Function runtime failure does not take down
ordinary cart operations across the shop. In that failure mode Shopify can
retain unmodified, undiscounted component lines; signed policy validation still
owns benefits whenever the Function executes successfully.

The authorization signer consumes only the canonical public runtime product
shape (`steps[].products` and `steps[].categories`). The sync owner passes the
normalized public subscription config and persisted offer country policy as
explicit inputs, so those policy fields are included in the signed bundle token
without guessing between Prisma relation names and storefront DTO names.

The public Storefront token is intentionally browser-visible and grants only
Storefront API access. It is not the HMAC secret. The signing secret remains on
the CartTransform/Discount Function owner and is never emitted to Liquid.

## Failure Boundaries

During a Wolfpack outage, an already-synchronized parent-product PPB can render,
query live Shopify catalog state, add an authorized bundle, apply native bundle
pricing/add-on/subscription discounts, and update `$app.bundle_details` through
Storefront API. Merchant saves, new installations, re-sync, app-proxy FPB,
automatic PPB embed lookup, page-builder lookup, analytics, and checkout-editor
configuration remain service-dependent.

If Shopify Storefront API itself is unavailable, the widget fails closed rather
than using stale prices or inventory. If a merchant changes a source collection
during an outage, the last synchronized membership remains authoritative until
the next bundle sync.
