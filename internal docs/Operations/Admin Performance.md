# Admin Performance

## Web Vitals Source

Shopify App Bridge is the source of embedded Admin Web Vitals used for Built for Shopify assessment. The root document must keep:

- `<meta name="shopify-api-key" ...>`
- `<script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/app-bridge.js">`

The App Bridge script should be the first script in `<head>` and should not be pinned to a versioned URL.

Shopify's Dev Dashboard is the field-data authority for BFS: it shows daily and
28-day p75 rollups using the same data as the App Store assessment. LCP passes
at `2500` ms or less and requires at least 100 recorded LCP calls in the last 28
days before Shopify assesses it.

Wolfpack does not ship an Admin Web Vitals collector or endpoint. Shopify Web Vitals remains the field-data source. For a major Admin UI change, temporarily recreate the documented Chrome-only LCP bridge in dev/SIT, measure the exact embedded route and candidate, and remove the bridge before commit. Never restore app-owned persistence or `/api/web-vitals`.

Temporary cross-origin verification bridge:

Do not keep the parent-frame `postMessage` verification bridge in committed
runtime code. It was removed after the local dashboard optimization pass. When a
future major Admin UI change requires route-level LCP work and DevTools cannot
read the cross-origin iframe directly, recreate the bridge temporarily in dev/SIT
using the local console API above as the data source, then remove it before
shipping.

Use the summary after repeated route loads to prove local p75. A route passes
the local target only when its p75 is strictly below `2500` ms. For field proof, collect
enough real Shopify Web Vitals samples by route and device class; a single
Chrome session or dev tunnel run is not field p75 proof.

## Embedded Admin LCP Findings

Measured in the Shopify Admin chrome on `agent-5sfidg3m` / SIT using
`?wpbWebVitalsDebug=1`.

| Route | Iframe LCP candidate / source-audited candidate | Fix status |
|---|---|---|
| `/app/dashboard` | Measured: support card description text | Render useful Dashboard content as soon as route data is available. Resolve proxy health, published-theme status, and 30-day commercial metrics asynchronously in their owned native surfaces; none may gate the bundle workspace. Keep row action-menu content lazy until merchant intent because closed overlays are not Dashboard page content. Mount the app-embed tutorial media only after the merchant opens its instructional modal so the initial Dashboard route does not request either video source. |
| `/app/bundles/create` | Measured: bundle type thumbnail rendered via `/ppb.avif` | Preloaded in route `links()` and HTTP `Link`; adjacent `/fpb.avif` also preloaded. The thumbnail is now a CSS background with stable dimensions, and local candidate paint was under target. |
| `/app/integrations` | Measured: text content | Remove the artificial 800ms readiness interval; the static integration catalog paints immediately. |
| `/app/billing` | Source audit: no first-viewport owned image | No image preload fix |
| `/app/billing/plans` | Measured: pricing text | Render the title immediately and use a small Polaris loading state while deferred subscription data resolves. Do not render card-shaped skeleton geometry. |
| `/app/bundles/cart-transform` | Source audit: no first-viewport owned image | No image preload fix |
| `/app/attribution` | Measured: critical funnel heading | Render the title and critical funnel heading before deferred data. Keep pixel status and the dashboard behind one inline Polaris loading boundary, with dashboard JavaScript and CSS resolving atomically. |
| `/app/settings` | Measured: landing text | Paint the landing cards without awaiting deferred workspace data. The complete Settings workspace, including Design, remains lazy-loaded through one post-click boundary. Do not add speculative preloads. |
| `/app/upload-store-file` | Source audit: asset uploads are merchant-initiated and not initial route hero content | No route preload |
| Configure routes | Measured: text paragraph in the initial configure canvas | Render the loaded configure canvas immediately, fetch product/currency/locales in one Admin GraphQL request, and split inactive sections and closed overlays from the initial production chunk. The App Embed lookup remains a live guard before Preview; it must not gate the editor. |

Pages without first-viewport owned media should be treated as text/bootstrap-bound
unless a future debug run logs an owned image candidate. For text LCP pages, do
not add image preloads speculatively; focus on loader critical path and reducing
first-render JavaScript instead.

### Dashboard deferred status and metrics

The dashboard paints its bundle workspace and support cards without awaiting
commercial analytics. The 30-day metrics promise starts beside the required
bundle query but resolves inside its own `Suspense`/`Await` boundary after the
support cards. Order IDs are queried through Admin GraphQL in batches of at most
250. Shopify MoneyBag shop and presentment subtotals normalize attributed bundle
amounts into the shop currency; missing or mismatched money rejects the whole
metrics boundary so the UI never displays a partial mixed-currency total.

Published-theme extension status remains client-side because App Bridge
`shopify.app.extensions()` is the canonical source. One shared hook owns the
initial request and all refresh paths; the dashboard must not issue a parallel
status check during mount. A fresh SIT route-level LCP measurement remains a
release gate for this major Admin UI change, and any temporary debug bridge must
be removed before shipping.

### Billing progressive first paint

The `/app/billing/plans` route must keep its visible Billing heading outside the
deferred subscription boundary. Entitlement verification and the active bundle
count can resolve in parallel without withholding useful route content; only the
quota, value proposition, plan, comparison, and FAQ regions depend on that
result. While those regions are pending, the route uses the shared small Polaris
loading state beneath the already-painted heading.

This render-path contract is covered by
`tests/unit/routes/admin-billing-progressive-render.test.ts`. A fresh SIT iframe
measurement is still required after source changes; Shopify Admin outer-shell
LCP is not evidence for the embedded route and must not be reported as Billing
LCP.

## Settings Design Control Panel

The Settings landing route paints its small Polaris card shell immediately;
deferred workspace data is needed only after a merchant selects a workspace.
The workspace implementation remains behind a separate React lazy boundary. The 2026-07-23 local
production build split the initial Settings route (`app.settings`, 2.99 kB /
1.27 kB gzip) from the complete `SettingsRoute` workspace (81.39 kB / 18.60 kB
gzip, plus 22.22 kB / 4.30 kB gzip CSS). The template-specific scene registry,
fixture model, and local surface renderers accounted for the historical
workspace increase; the current production renderer is isolated behind its own
post-click frame route.
Design is statically part of that post-click workspace chunk, so entering Design
does not wait for a second sequential JavaScript request. The workspace chunk is
not required for the first Settings paint.

The landing stylesheet is a CSS-module dependency of `SettingsLandingShell` and
is declared as a Settings-route CSS dependency in the production build manifest.
Do not expose it as an independent route `links()` URL: during client-side Admin
navigation, that separate request can finish after the landing component renders
and cause an unstyled first paint followed by a second styled layout. Keeping the
CSS in the component dependency graph lets Remix preload it with the route module
without adding a render delay or loading-state workaround. The three
landing cards are the complete interactive targets and do not render
separate button-like `Configure` labels. Each card uses a framed section icon,
clear title and description hierarchy, and a trailing directional affordance;
hover, keyboard-focus, and reduced-motion states are owned by the landing shell.
Their desktop content area uses the same two-of-twelve-column gutter on each
side as the template selection surface, and the card group is centered in the
available viewport. The grid uses three columns at wide widths and one column
when the embedded app surface is narrow. After a Design or Language card is
selected, the destination title remains visible and a small Polaris spinner
occupies only the unresolved workspace region. There is no card skeleton or
artificial minimum loading interval.

Controls uses a dedicated route. Selecting its Settings card leaves the landing
cards visible while Shopify's native Admin header indicator reports the Remix
navigation. The Controls route renders its title and a small Polaris spinner
until deferred Settings data is ready.

The Settings workspace owns a preview-first two-column layout: the centered
preview canvas and selectors sit beside the active inspector. Phone containers
expose Preview and Customize as a two-state segmented control so only one dense
workspace pane renders at a time. Breakpoints are container-driven because the
usable Shopify Admin iframe width is independent of the browser viewport.
On desktop, the inspector can collapse from a Polaris chevron that straddles the
column boundary. Collapse state is page-local, releases the inspector column to
the preview, and preserves unsaved values and preview context. The preview fit
observer must respond to that width change. The chevron is absent in narrow
containers, where the existing Preview and Customize pane control remains the
only workspace disclosure.

The desktop preview stage uses a decorative 1320×920 Mac-style display canvas.
Its visible 1280×800 screen owns the desktop scrollbar and contains the unchanged
1280×1136 storefront renderer, so the Admin frame stays proportionally wide
without changing the storefront viewport contract. The desktop stage explicitly
owns the full available inline size; otherwise its aspect ratio and height cap
can resolve the stage itself to the device width and leave the monitor aligned to
the start after the inspector collapses. Mobile presentation adds a
decorative 428×882 iPhone 14 Pro body adapted from the MIT-licensed Devices.css
geometry outside the iframe; the production renderer still receives the
unchanged 390×844 viewport and its scrollbar remains hidden. Frame padding sits
outside both production viewports so storefront content is never cropped by the
shell. A collapsed desktop state must not retain its 720px grid minimum after
the Admin container crosses into the phone layout.

The desktop inspector is a sticky, full-available-height sidebar whose internal
content scrolls independently. Its disclosure chevron is positioned against the
sidebar edge rather than participating in document flow, keeping the inspector
top aligned with the complete Live preview panel in expanded and collapsed
states. Both sticky owners use the same zero top inset; applying a sticky offset
to only the sidebar makes its card begin below the Live preview container before
either surface reaches its sticky threshold.

The Live preview panel and customization sidebar share the same viewport-height
workspace row on desktop. The preview header occupies the first row and the
device stage fills the remaining height, so changing viewport or collapsing the
inspector cannot make the two cards end at different block positions. Narrow
Admin containers return both panes to content-driven height.

Inside the isolated 390x844 mobile preview frame, the FPB summary tray is pinned
to the frame viewport bottom. This preview-only positioning prevents area-focus
`scrollIntoView` calls from carrying the production sticky tray upward with the
document while leaving the deployed storefront tray and its sticky contract
unchanged.

Design renderer failures use contextual, dismissible critical Polaris banners
beside the affected preview because the surface remains unavailable. A failed
storefront-preview launch belongs only to that attempt and uses a transient App
Bridge error toast; retrying starts a clean operation. Banner wrappers retain
Polaris block spacing from adjacent preview content.

Preview fitting must not use React state for ResizeObserver samples. Coalesce
the latest content-box measurement to one requestAnimationFrame callback and
write canvas width, canvas height, and shell scale together. The workspace grid,
readiness opacity, and scale must not interpolate with CSS transitions; this
keeps sidebar collapse and Admin-width changes immediate without repeatedly
reconciling the production iframe subtree.

The preview toolbar separates template-filtered `Edit area` and `Preview state`
selectors. Area changes reuse the mounted renderer, return transient state to
Default, and scroll the selected production region into a persistent frame-owned
outline. State changes open the existing production picker, loading, validation,
or upsell implementation without replacing the neutral storefront chrome. The
Upsell state hides the bundle builder and places the production offer immediately
after a local product purchase form, matching the runtime's automatic product-page
anchor contract. The frame guards production loading dismissal only while Loading
is selected, then restores normal dismissal when the state changes; it does not add
polling, timers, or a second loading renderer. Neither selector adds data loading,
persistence, or another lazy boundary.

Direct Chrome DevTools verification on 2026-08-27 used the agent store after a
cache-bypassed reload. The 1881×900 expanded-inspector and collapsed-inspector
states, plus the 900×900 narrow-Admin state, kept the live 390×844 mobile
renderer inside the full device screen and allowed the desktop renderer to
consume released width. A traced inspector-collapse interaction reported 33ms
observed INP and 0.00 CLS with no throttling. This is interaction diagnostic
evidence, not Shopify field-performance data.

The preview frame route uses deterministic local fixture data with the actual
FPB or PPB controller and exact family/template stylesheet manifest. A neutral
store header plus full-page or product-detail shell supplies realistic context
without coupling the preview to a merchant theme. Fixed logical 1280×1136 and
390×844 canvases scale as a whole and center on both axes. The frame accepts only
versioned same-origin commands, uses local media, blocks navigation and cart
submission, and disables analytics, persistence, app-proxy loading, and post-cart
effects. Local Design editing therefore remains available without a
storefront-ready bundle; only the separate Preview Bundle action requires one.
Before the FPB controller mounts, its frame root must carry the production
`bundle-widget-container bundle-widget-full-page` host classes. The shared
responsive and template styles are scoped through that contract; omitting it can
silently turn a desktop template into a single-column card list with its summary
below the products even though the production controller itself rendered.

Fixture product PNGs remain compact and local. Do not preload them on the
Settings landing route because the Design workspace remains behind the
post-click lazy boundary.

For interaction acceptance, measure at least ten cache-bypassed Design entries
from card activation until the live preview controls and surface are usable.
The click-to-preview target is p75 at or below `750ms`. Intent-based workspace
prefetching is justified only if the single-boundary implementation misses that
target in SIT.

For local acceptance, collect at least ten cache-bypassed loads of
`/app/settings?wpbWebVitalsDebug=1`, enter Design on each pass, and inspect the
app-owned sample set. The planned Design target is LCP p75 at or below `2000ms`,
with a hard failure at or above `2500ms`, and CLS below `0.1`. Shopify/App Bridge field
metrics after a manual SIT deployment remain the final p75 source of truth.

## Removed Custom Telemetry

The previous app-owned Web Vitals pipeline was retired on 2026-06-12:

- `app/lib/web-vitals.client.ts`
- `app/routes/api/api.web-vitals.tsx`
- Prisma model/table `AdminWebVital`
- npm dependency `web-vitals`

Do not recreate custom `/api/web-vitals` telemetry for BFS eligibility. Use Shopify-collected metrics for BFS and Chrome Performance / Network `Server-Timing` for local diagnosis.

The retired `/api/web-vitals` tombstone route has been removed. Stale clients
receive the normal missing-route response; no app-owned collector, persistence,
or compatibility endpoint remains.

## Critical Path Rule

The `/app` layout loader keeps Shopify authentication on the critical path.
Expiring offline-token acquisition, refresh, and session serialization belong
to Shopify's Remix authentication and Prisma session-storage integration; the
loader does not run app-owned migration or refresh maintenance.

The `/app/dashboard` loader keeps non-critical Admin checks off the response
path. App-embed status is read client-side from `shopify.app.extensions()`;
web-pixel reconciliation remains a post-response background task. The initial
payload contains the shop, bundle summary, and API key required for the native
App Bridge check.

The shared `/app` shell must not import or await providers that do not have
runtime consumers on every Admin page. On 2026-07-10, the global Mantle provider
and server-side Mantle identify call were removed from the app shell after an
audit found no runtime consumers. The remaining unused server helper and package
dependency were removed with the managed-pricing cutover on 2026-08-28. Keep
future analytics providers route-scoped until a shared runtime consumer exists.

## Admin Mobile and First-Load Contract

The authenticated `/app` index renders a centered Polaris spinner with the
localized `Loading your workspace` message while the client resolves auth
parameters and the Dashboard destination. It must not return a blank iframe or
render a route-shaped skeleton during that interval. The `/app/dashboard`
route then paints useful content without waiting for proxy-health or App Embed
status; those checks update only their owned warning surfaces. The App Embed
surface shows a non-dismissible informational spinner while its App Bridge
check is unresolved, even when a resolved banner was dismissed earlier in the
session.

The authenticated `/app` shell calls Shopify's App Bridge `shopify.loading`
API for every child-route transition to a different pathname and stops it when
the destination commits or the effect cleans up. The existing route stays
rendered during that transition. Same-screen revalidation and form submission
do not start the Admin header indicator.

Route-local React state and Remix fetchers avoid a separate Admin state vendor
chunk. The Analytics route uses its local accessible SVG funnel and must not
reach `vendor-charts`. Production manifest verification must show that the app
layout and every embedded Admin route avoid both `vendor-state` and
`vendor-charts`.

Merchant workflow roots should use descriptive `s-query-container` names when
their responsive behavior depends on embedded app width. Current shared roots
include `dashboard-bundles`, `settings-landing`, `design-settings`,
`pricing-page`, `billing-page`, `events-page`, `storefront-setup-card`,
`integrations-page`, `analytics-page`, and `bundle-configure`. Page shells remain shrinkable, use responsive inline
padding, and keep horizontal scrolling inside labelled data regions rather than
on the document.

Analytics imports the dashboard component and its CSS from the eager
`AttributionRouteShell`. This is an intentional ownership boundary: keeping the
CSS module behind a lazy React component produced a visible unstyled interval
in the Vite-served embedded app, including after hot reloads.
The pixel status promise resolves independently into a native top banner, while
the title and critical funnel heading remain immediately available and the
dashboard data boundary uses the shared CSS-free Polaris loading state.
Analytics has one page-level banner owner: UTM pixel status. Zero-value metric
surfaces communicate the no-data state without a second banner, and backfill
action results use Shopify toast feedback. Informational banners inside the
pixel, backfill, and custom-UTM modals are local to those overlay contexts.

## 2026-07-30 Shared Shell and Onboarding Completion

The authenticated Admin layout uses the App Bridge global and Polaris web
components. `app/root.tsx` loads the unversioned `polaris.js` script immediately
after the required unversioned App Bridge script. The shared `/app` route no
longer loads the React Polaris provider, Polaris translation JSON, the 444KB
legacy stylesheet, or a global Redux provider. The standalone auth login route
uses the same globally registered Polaris web components around its standard
Remix form, so it does not require a React Polaris provider, translation bundle,
or stylesheet either.

The 2026-07-30 production chunk graph kept legacy React Polaris in
`vendor-polaris-react`, App Bridge React hooks in `vendor-app-bridge-react`,
Redux in `vendor-state`, and charts in `vendor-charts`. The later Shopify-native
cutover removed the React Polaris, Redux, and chart dependencies and their
manual chunks. App Bridge React remains because authenticated Admin routes use
Shopify's hooks. Analytics continues to request its lazy dashboard JavaScript
and CSS in the same import boundary.

The 2026-09-07 Shopify-native remediation removed Redux, RTK Query, Recharts,
and their manual Vite chunks from the deployable Admin. Configure and Dashboard
state is route-local React state or reducers; server interactions use Remix
loaders, actions, and fetchers. `vendor-app-bridge-react` remains because the
Admin uses Shopify's App Bridge React hooks.

The standalone onboarding route has been removed. Authenticated `/app` entries
always continue to the dashboard, so the shared layout no longer queries
`firstCreateTourEligible`. The create handler still claims that flag atomically
after required creation succeeds and uses it only to open the post-create
configure tour. Settings returns its established `settingsPage` and
`previewBundles` loader fields as deferred promises; the landing cards paint
without awaiting them, and the selected workspace owns inline Polaris loading
and its existing error state.

First-create eligibility is claimed with one conditional `updateMany` only
after the bundle and required Shopify parent product exist. A later widget
installation status failure is logged as noncritical and returns
`widgetStatus.checked = false`; it cannot convert the already-created bundle
into a failed create response. Guided-tour dismissal and completion remain
shop-keyed, and Escape now follows the same persistence, focus restoration, and
body-scroll cleanup path.

## 2026-07-06 Attribution LCP Follow-up

A fresh Chrome trace on `/app/attribution?wpbWebVitalsDebug=1&days=7` showed
the lab LCP candidate as the outer Shopify Admin page-title H1 (`Analytics`),
not an iframe chart, banner, or image. The app-owned lever for that candidate is
how quickly the route emits `<ui-title-bar title="Analytics">`.

The attribution route now uses a lightweight shell that renders the title bar
before loading the analytics dashboard module. The dashboard module is delayed
briefly after shell mount so chart and analytics chunks do not compete with the
Admin shell title paint. Support chat auto-load also uses the delayed fallback
instead of `requestIdleCallback`, because Chrome can run idle callbacks before
LCP on quiet traces; explicit support-click loading still opens chat
immediately. Delayed SDK loading does not hide the launcher: the app queues
`chat:show` for every viewport and has no phone-only media-query or close-event
suppression.

If attribution remains above target in field data, keep optimizing the route
shell and parent Admin boot path first. Do not add attribution image preloads:
the confirmed candidate is text in the Shopify Admin shell.

## 2026-07-10 Candidate Fix Proof

Dev/SIT measurements used a temporary parent-frame `postMessage` bridge to read
the iframe's browser `largest-contentful-paint` candidate from
`PerformanceObserver`. The bridge was removed before committing runtime code.

Spot checks after the candidate fixes:

| Route | Previous candidate/value | Post-fix candidate/value |
|---|---:|---:|
| `/app/attribution` | inactive tracking body copy and deferred funnel title, ~8-9s | `h2#wpb-critical-funnel-hero-title`, 1460ms |
| `/app/dashboard` | `/bundleGallery.avif` ~6164ms, then `/appEmbed.avif` ~4572ms | support card text, 1700ms |
| `/app/bundles/create` | `/ppb.avif` p75 previously above target | `/ppb.avif`, 1156ms |

These are dev tunnel spot checks, not Shopify field p75. Final BFS proof still
comes from Shopify-collected field metrics after deployment.

## 2026-08-23 Settings Design workspace follow-up

Settings -> Design remains behind the existing lazy workspace boundary. This
entry records the former handcrafted React/CSS preview; it was replaced on
2026-08-27 by the isolated production-renderer frame described above. The
workspace still presents template, component, and viewport controls with one
contextual inspector, and phone containers still switch between Preview and
Customize without creating a second preview or persisted pane state.

The Settings loader starts the Storefront Shop Brand query alongside deferred
workspace reads, so the Settings landing response is not held until Brand data
resolves. A fresh Design-entry LCP measurement still requires the temporary
`?wpbWebVitalsDebug=1` bridge in user-provided SIT. Do not commit that bridge;
record the measured candidate and value here after direct Chrome verification,
then remove the temporary runtime code before shipping.

## 2026-08-25 Agent-Store LCP Matrix

Direct Chrome DevTools measured the signed-in `agent-5sfidg3m` SIT app iframe.
Each row uses ten cache-bypassed iframe document loads at 1440 x 900 desktop and
390 x 844 mobile, except PPB first-create mobile, which has nine valid entries.
The temporary cross-origin observer was removed after the pass. Values are local
development-tunnel p75, not Shopify field data.

| Admin surface | Observed iframe candidate | Desktop p75 | Mobile p75 | Baseline result |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| App entry redirect (`/app`) | Dashboard text after redirect | 3328ms | 3008ms | Bootstrap flow fails; not a distinct page |
| Dashboard | Support-card description / heading | 2268ms | 2004ms | Pass |
| Create Bundle | PPB thumbnail | 1544ms | 1136ms | Pass |
| Settings landing | Landing text | 3700ms | 2448ms | Desktop fail |
| Additional Configurations | Description paragraph | 2072ms | 1860ms | Pass |
| Integrations | Catalog text | 2876ms | 2412ms | Desktop fail |
| Analytics | Critical funnel heading | 2412ms | 2472ms | Pass, narrow |
| Pricing | Pricing text | 1588ms | 1352ms | Pass |
| Updates and FAQs | Page text | 1304ms | 1064ms | Pass |
| Billing | Plan heading | 2140ms | 2068ms | Pass |
| FPB configure, edit | Step/category paragraph | 3332ms | 4324ms | Fail |
| FPB configure, first-create | Step/category paragraph | 3140ms | 3772ms | Fail |
| PPB configure, edit | Step Setup paragraph | 3012ms | 2592ms | Fail |
| PPB configure, first-create | Step Setup paragraph | 2800ms | 2848ms | Fail |

Candidate-owned fixes from this pass:

- Dashboard, FPB, and PPB no longer gate useful content on App Embed or proxy
  warning lookups.
- Settings landing no longer waits for deferred workspace data or an artificial
  loading-bar interval.
- Integrations no longer waits for an artificial 800ms readiness interval.
- FPB and PPB use one route-blocking Admin GraphQL request for product, currency,
  and published locales instead of three concurrent requests.
- Configure Step Setup stays in the initial module while inactive sections and
  closed overlays are production code-split and loaded after document load.

Ten-load desktop post-fix p75 was 2448ms for Settings and 1304ms for
Integrations. FPB edit improved to 2876ms. PPB edit produced nine valid samples
with a provisional 2900ms p75. Navigation timing showed two dev-only modes:
2.2-2.9s route responses followed by paint within about 20-40ms, or fast
0.5-0.6s responses followed by the unbundled Vite module graph. The production
build emitted the two configure route chunks at 30.18 and 31.60 kB gzip and
separate chunks for every inactive section and overlay group. Therefore the
strict configure target is not proven by the dev tunnel; verify `<2500ms` with
Shopify route/device field p75 after manual SIT deployment. Do not add more
local-only loading placeholders or speculative preloads to force the lab metric.

## 2026-08-27 Settings Design context-frame follow-up

Direct Chrome DevTools repeated ten cache-bypassed Settings loads at 1440 x 900
on `agent-5sfidg3m` while the temporary iframe-to-parent LCP bridge was active.
Nine app-content candidates produced a 2416ms p75. One late 13832ms candidate
was a 1050px data-URI SVG inside a `span`, distinct from the 10808px Settings
content candidate; retaining it makes the raw ten-sample observer p75 2880ms.
This is local dev-tunnel evidence, not an App Bridge or Shopify field p75 pass.

The rapid mobile cache-bypass loop stopped mounting the Shopify app iframe and
left it at `about:blank`, so no mobile LCP sample set was accepted. Mobile
layout verification had already passed in the mounted iframe before the loop.
The temporary observer and parent bridge were removed after measurement. The
Design context-frame work remains behind the existing post-click lazy boundary
and does not add work to the Settings landing render path.

### 2026-08-27 preview-readiness and notch verification

Direct Chrome DevTools on the signed-in `agent-5sfidg3m` Admin verified the
Design canvas readiness overlay under Fast 3G: the centered Polaris spinner
card remained visible while the preview frame was `about:blank`, then cleared
only after the same-origin frame rendered and sent `READY`. Desktop expanded
and collapsed states kept the inspector disclosure notch centered on the
visible sidebar edge; the collapsed state widened the desktop preview. At a
900 x 900 narrow-Admin viewport, the notch remained hidden and Preview /
Customize navigation remained available.

After one warm-up load, the stable temporary app-frame observer recorded ten
cache-bypassed desktop route loads at 1881 x 900 with no throttling: 2460,
2108, 2188, 1876, 1920, 2492, 1664, 2144, 4440, and 2164ms. The resulting p75
was 2460ms: below the 2500ms hard gate, but above the planned 2000ms target.
The observer could not retain a stable element reference for these samples, so
this pass does not attribute the remaining delay to a specific app-owned
candidate. Earlier samples collected while the diagnostic source itself was
hot-reloading were discarded because Vite recompilation contaminated them. A
separate outer-Admin Chrome trace reported LCP 5574ms and CLS 0.00; its LCP
element was Shopify's
Polaris page-title `h1`, with 433ms TTFB and 5141ms render delay, and therefore
is not app-frame candidate proof. The spinner remains behind the post-click
Design lazy boundary and cannot account for Settings landing LCP. Treat this as
local dev-tunnel evidence requiring a focused route-response and candidate
follow-up, not Shopify field p75. The temporary observer and parent bridge were
removed before commit.

## 2026-09-05 Analytics conversion-funnel dependency removal

`/app/attribution` replaces the funnel bars, Bundle Split area chart, and
campaign-row revenue meters with a dependency-free accessible SVG conversion
funnel. The BOGOS-style bundle commerce extension adds six text KPI cards and
two small dependency-free SVG sales trends; it does not restore Recharts or the
route-specific chart chunk.
The visualization consumes the existing `views.totalViews`,
`funnelSnapshot.addedToCart`, and `funnelSnapshot.checkedOut` values. Commerce
metrics separate the Shopify whole-order value from the discounted bundle-line
value so multi-bundle orders do not duplicate order revenue or order counts.
The attribution pixel now preserves Shopify Web Pixel `finalLinePrice`, while
manual backfill reads Admin GraphQL `currentTotalPriceSet` and
`discountedTotalSet(withCodeDiscounts: true)`; the app stores that verified
bundle-line value separately from whole-order revenue.

The route shell continues to render `h2#wpb-critical-funnel-hero-title` before
the deferred Analytics payload. The resolved SVG remains inside the dashboard
boundary, uses a labelled horizontal overflow region at narrow widths, and
does not add work to the critical shell. The 2026-09-05 production build emitted
no `vendor-charts` asset, and the Analytics manifest entry contains no chart
dependency import. A cache-bypassed embedded SIT measurement on
`agent-5sfidg3m` retained `h2#wpb-critical-funnel-hero-title` as the app-owned
LCP candidate at 1784ms. This is a dev-tunnel spot check, not Shopify field p75
evidence. The temporary cross-origin observer and parent bridge were removed
immediately after the measurement.

## 2026-09-07 Configure loader request alignment

The shared FPB/PPB configure loader again fetches the bundle product, shop
currency/timezone, and published locales through one Shopify Admin GraphQL
request. A source drift had restored three separate requests even though the
route contract and test spec required one.

Optional product and locale field errors retain their merchant-safe behavior:
the editor still opens with a null product or empty locale list when Shopify
returns usable partial shop data. Currency and timezone remain required and the
loader does not fabricate fallbacks or start a second request chain. This
reduces route-blocking Admin API work without replacing useful configure
content, delaying editor readiness, or weakening Preview and save safeguards.
