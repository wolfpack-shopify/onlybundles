# Shopify-Native First — Do Not Reinvent the Wheel

Before planning or implementing anything, check whether Shopify already provides the capability through its canonical APIs, Functions, extensions, Admin components, platform configuration, or documented patterns. Use the Shopify-provided solution when it exists. Do not recreate Shopify behavior with custom models, secrets, endpoints, abstractions, fallback chains, or duplicated business logic merely because a custom implementation is possible.

If existing project logic conflicts with Shopify's current recommended approach, replace the incorrect logic with the canonical Shopify resource or API instead of preserving it through compatibility code. Add custom application logic only after evidence shows that Shopify does not provide the required capability, and keep that logic limited to the demonstrated gap.

# Claude Code Development Guidelines

## Core Operating Principles

1. **Ask, do not assume.** If something is unclear, ask before writing a single line. No silent guesses about intent, architecture, or requirements.
2. **Simplest solution first.** Implement the simplest thing that could work. No abstractions or flexibility you did not explicitly request.
3. **Do not touch unrelated code.** If a file or function is not part of the current task, do not modify it even if you think it could be improved.
4. **Flag uncertainty explicitly.** If you are not confident about an approach or technical detail, say so before proceeding. Confidence without certainty causes damage.

### Open/Closed and Cohesion Rule

Do not use file length, line-count tests, or oversized-file allowlists as
architecture gates. They measure formatting and encourage arbitrary extraction
without proving that the design or behavior improved.

Keep a module cohesive even when it is long. Split it only when the extracted
unit has a distinct responsibility, data owner, lifecycle, platform boundary,
or behavior that can be named and verified independently. A good split should
reduce the dependencies needed to understand or change each owner; moving JSX
or logic behind a large pass-through prop bag solely to shorten a file is not an
improvement.

Apply the Open/Closed Principle at real variation points: keep stable owners
closed to unrelated edits and add a narrow typed component, adapter, strategy,
or handler when a new Shopify surface, bundle type, pricing method, or workflow
truly varies. Prefer direct imports and explicit feature props. Do not create a
generic abstraction for code that only looks similar or is expected to have
different bundle-type semantics.

Tests must protect behavior, public contracts, validation, persistence, and
integration wiring. Do not add tests that inspect source length, file names,
internal class names, or the mere presence or absence of implementation text.

## Architecture and Gotcha Documentation

### Canny Changelog Publication Authorization

The user authorizes agents to draft and publish Only Bundles changelog entries
through the logged-in Canny dashboard without asking for repeat publication
approval. Canny login and MFA are always handled by the user: if login is
required, stop that browser workflow and prompt the user to log in. Never
retrieve credentials or attempt login on their behalf.

- Evaluate every change for merchant impact. Publish meaningful new features,
  improvements, fixes, and breaking changes that merchants need to know about.
  Do not publish internal refactors, test-only changes, or unsupported claims.
- Before writing, check existing drafts and published entries for duplicates.
  Preserve unrelated drafts. Use Canny's New, Improved, or Fixed classification.
- Drafts may be prepared during development. Publish only after the matching
  production release is live and its merchant behavior has been verified.
  A local/SIT test or merged commit alone is not release proof.
- For action-required changes, state affected merchants, exact required steps,
  any verified deadline, and the consequence of not acting. Reference the
  existing bundle Sync prompt where applicable; do not invent deadlines.
- Verify the published entry URL and its appearance through the Dashboard bell.
  Keep Canny as the source of truth; do not add publishing APIs or a parallel
  local release-note database.
- Development/SIT fixtures and test entries belong only in Only Bundles QA.
  Never put test feedback or simulated releases in the production workspace.
- This authorization does not override manual Shopify deployment gates or
  authorize paid plan upgrades. See `internal docs/Operations/Canny.md`.

Do not create issue files or run the feature pipeline by default. They are overhead for normal repo work.

Document only durable knowledge:
- **Core architecture changes** — update the relevant note in `internal docs/` and link it from `internal docs/index.md`.
- **Gotcha moments** — document non-obvious debugging findings, Shopify/API behavior, build constraints, deployment quirks, or data-model facts that will matter again.
- **Routine edits** — do not create process docs for ordinary implementation progress, cosmetic changes, or one-off fixes.

### Documentation Metadata Standard

Every new Markdown documentation file, and every existing Markdown documentation file that receives a material documentation update, must begin with YAML frontmatter using exactly these fields in this order:

```yaml
---
schema_version: 1
id: <stable-kebab-case-id>
title: <document-title>
type: <document-type>
status: <document-status>
summary: <one-sentence-summary>
last_audited: YYYY-MM-DD
owners:
  - <owner>
domains:
  - <domain>
systems:
  - <system>
source_paths:
  - <source-path>
related_docs:
  - <related-document-path>
tags:
  - <tag>
keywords:
  - <search-keyword>
---
```

Do not omit, rename, reorder, or add metadata fields unless the user explicitly changes this standard. Use empty YAML lists (`[]`) when a list field has no values. Keep `id` stable across renames and moves, and update `last_audited` whenever the document is materially verified or revised.

---

## 🧪 Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Write tests **before** implementation. Cycle: Red → Green → Refactor.

### Test file locations
```
apps/OnlyBundles-app/tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── lib/          ← helpers, utilities
│   ├── services/     ← server services
│   ├── routes/       ← route action/loader functions
│   └── extensions/   ← cart transform, checkout UI
├── integration/      ← multi-layer flows
└── e2e/              ← full request lifecycle
```
File naming: `{module-name}.test.ts`

### What must be tested
- Every exported function in `apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/lib/`
- Every auth guard path (authorized, unauthorized, missing env var)
- Every route `action` and `loader` — happy path + error cases
- Any function with conditional branching or security logic

```bash
npm test | npm run test:unit | npm run test:watch | npm run test:coverage
```

TDD does NOT apply to: one-line config changes, CSS-only changes, docs changes, route annotation comments.

### Parity Fixture Transitions

For parity matrix testing, do not fully restore the fixture after every item. Each
new parity pass must remove only configuration that is incompatible or no longer
required, add only the configuration needed for the current item or fixture
group, and carry compatible state forward. Perform a full restoration only at a
fixture-group boundary or when malformed or contaminated state makes the
evidence unreliable.

### 🚫 No UI Styling or Placement Unit Tests

**A unit test must verify a component's BEHAVIOUR, never its CSS, class names, or where it sits on the screen.** These tests are useless: they fail on harmless cosmetic refactors, never catch real bugs, and ossify implementation details.

**Banned patterns — do not write, and remove on sight:**
- For storefront templates, implement styling changes (dividers, borders, spacing, alignment, spacing/padding, height/width-related presentation) in CSS files, not through JavaScript DOM injection or runtime HTML composition.
- Reading a `.css` / `.module.css` file with `fs.readFileSync(...)` and asserting on CSS properties (`width:`, `height:`, `padding:`, `margin:`, `grid-template-columns`, `font-size:`, `color:`, `background:`, `border-radius:`, etc.).
- Reading a `.tsx` / `.jsx` / `.js` source file and asserting that a CSS class name is present (`expect(source).toContain("styles.someClass")` or `expect(source).toContain('className="...')`).
- Asserting on element order via `indexOf` comparisons on source text (`expect(source.indexOf("A")).toBeLessThan(source.indexOf("B"))`) to verify "X renders before Y on screen".
- Reading widget JS sources to grep for CSS selectors, layout markers, or visual contracts.
- "Pixel parity" / "layout contract" / "UI contract" tests that snapshot how a component LOOKS in source code.

**What you SHOULD test:**
- Pure functions: inputs → outputs. (A function whose JOB is to produce CSS as a string — e.g. a CSS generator — is fair game, because its OUTPUT is the behaviour.)
- Conditional rendering / branching logic: render with prop X, assert a returned value or side effect — NOT a class name.
- Data flow: action dispatched → state changed → API called with the right shape.
- Route action/loader behaviour: happy path + error cases.
- Auth guards, validation, business rules.

**File-name red flags that almost always indicate a styling test:** `*-layout.test.ts`, `*-ui-contract.test.ts`, `*-parity-contract.test.ts`, `*-shell-layout.test.ts`, `*-admin-layout.test.ts`. New files matching these patterns are almost always wrong; treat them as a code smell during review.

If you need to verify visual parity with a competitor or design, do it with Chrome DevTools MCP / visual diff — not with a Jest test that greps a CSS file.

### Test Spec Files — Mandatory in TDD Sessions

Create `apps/OnlyBundles-app/test-spec/{module-name}.spec.md` alongside every Shopify-app TDD session.

```markdown
# Test Spec: {Module / Feature Name}
**Spec ID:** {module-name}  **Created:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Purpose
## Test Cases
### {TestSuiteName}
| # | Scenario | Input | Expected Output | Notes |
## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All listed test cases pass
```

---

## 🚫 Strict Rules

1. ❌ NEVER run `shopify app deploy` autonomously — see Shopify Deploy Rule
2. ✅ Write tests BEFORE implementation for all new code
3. ✅ Run linter on modified files BEFORE every commit — see Lint Before Commit
4. ❌ NO backwards-compatibility shims or migration hacks — see No Backwards Compatibility Rule
5. ✅ CREATE a test spec file in `apps/OnlyBundles-app/test-spec/` for every Shopify-app TDD session
6. ❌ NO hardcoded fallback UI copy strings — never fabricate merchant-facing marketing copy
7. ❌ NO unnecessary API fallback chains — use the single correct source per official docs
8. ❌ NEVER commit Chrome DevTools investigation screenshots
9. ❌ NO competitor references in code (`eb`, `skai`, `skailama`, `easybundles`) — docs only
10. ❌ NO unit tests that assert on CSS, class names, or element placement — see No UI Styling or Placement Unit Tests rule
11. ❌ NEVER commit package-lock.json without verifying Node 22 Docker clean install — see Node 22 Lockfile & Docker Sync Rule

---

## 📐 Responsive Storefront CSS Rule

Storefront template CSS must be responsive and content-driven. Do not overfit a template to one store, fixture, viewport, or competitor screenshot by copying precise captured pixel values into layout rules.

Use `clamp()`, `minmax()`, `%`, `fr`, viewport/container units, intrinsic sizing, and named design tokens for shell widths, grid tracks, card heights, sidebars, mobile trays, and spacing. Exact fixed values are acceptable only for true primitives such as hairline borders, icons, control hit targets, or documented Shopify/theme limits.

When visual parity requires measured evidence, keep exact measurements in docs or notes as evidence, then translate them into responsive CSS. Avoid `!important`; fix ownership, scope, or selector specificity instead.

---

## 🧩 Polaris Web Components First Rule

Use Polaris web components (`s-*`) for **all** Admin-embedded app UI. Fall back to custom HTML only when no Polaris component exists.

Before changing Admin UI composition, read
`internal docs/Shopify Integration/Polaris Web Components Reference.md`. It is
the single authority for durable cross-Admin design philosophy and composition
decisions. Add any new reusable Admin UI design decision to that file instead
of scattering it through feature-specific notes.

**Components (polaris-app-home surface):**
- Actions: `s-button`, `s-button-group`, `s-link`, `s-menu`
- Forms: `s-checkbox`, `s-select`, `s-text-field`, `s-text-area`, `s-switch`, `s-number-field`, `s-search-field`, `s-drop-zone`
- Feedback: `s-badge`, `s-banner`, `s-spinner`
- Layout: `s-box`, `s-stack`, `s-grid`, `s-section`, `s-divider`
- Typography: `s-heading`, `s-text`, `s-paragraph`
- Media: `s-icon`, `s-thumbnail`, `s-image`, `s-avatar`
- Overlays: `s-modal`, `s-popover`
- Interactive: `s-clickable`, `s-clickable-chip`, `s-chip`

**Icon names:** `plus`, `delete`, `view`, `upload`, `globe`, `search`, `filter`, `edit`, `info`, `check`, `x`, `duplicate`, `menu-horizontal`, `alert-triangle`, `clock`, `note`, `product`, `arrow-left`, `arrow-right`

**Acceptable custom HTML exceptions:** tab navigation, step chip/pill patterns, keyframe animations, fixed-position overlays, complex grids not achievable with `s-grid`.

Check availability: `mcp__shopify-dev-mcp__learn_shopify_api(api: "polaris-app-home")`

---

## 🔄 No Backwards Compatibility Rule

Do not consider writing any fallbacks to support legacy code. Ignore any legacy code and strive to update/remove any legacy code when you encounter it.

**NEVER add backwards-compatibility code.** The app has a "Sync Bundle" feature — merchants re-sync to pick up new defaults.

**Banned patterns:**
- Fallback shims reading old JSON blob fields when new direct columns exist
- Deprecated field mappings in `extractGeneralSettings` / `buildSettingsData`
- Version-detection code that adjusts behavior for old data
- `if (legacyField) use(legacyField) else use(newField)` patterns

**Correct approach:** Add new Prisma columns with sensible defaults. Drop old JSON blob keys. Bump `WIDGET_VERSION` and show a sync prompt banner for breaking changes.

---

## 🔍 Lint Before Commit Rule

```bash
npx eslint --max-warnings 9999 <file1> <file2> ...
# or full project:
npm run lint -- --max-warnings 9999
```

Zero ESLint errors required. Warnings acceptable (pre-existing ~6500 warnings in project). Fix new errors you introduced; leave pre-existing warnings.

---

## 🗺️ App Navigation Map

**MANDATORY:** Update `docs/app-nav-map/APP_NAVIGATION_MAP.md` whenever you:
- Add/rename/remove a route, page, modal, or tab
- Add a new Settings subpage, sidebar section, or configuration tab
- Add/change a user flow or add relevant API routes

---

## 🚢 Shopify Deploy Rule

**NEVER run `shopify app deploy` autonomously.** Always stop and prompt:

```
ACTION REQUIRED — Manual deploy needed.
Run in your terminal:
  npm run deploy:prod   ← PROD (wolfpack-product-bundles-4)
  npm run deploy:sit    ← SIT  (wolfpack-product-bundles-sit)
Reason: [brief explanation]
Let me know once it completes.
```

The root npm scripts delegate deployment to `apps/OnlyBundles-app` — never call `shopify app deploy` directly.

## 🧰 Global Shopify CLI Rule

Use the installed global Shopify CLI directly for local Shopify validation:

```bash
command -v shopify
type -a shopify
shopify version
shopify app build --help
```

Do not invoke Shopify CLI through `npx`, `pnpx`, or a project-local package.
This development machine currently resolves `shopify` from the active Node
installation under `~/.nvm/`; always use `command -v shopify` instead of
hardcoding that versioned path. Confirm the required subcommand with its own
`--help` output before relying on it. If a listed command is unexpectedly
unavailable, check for multiple installations before diagnosing the command
surface itself.

Keep exactly one global Shopify CLI installation active. Before diagnosing a
CLI-only failure, run `type -a shopify`; an npm/NVM installation and a Homebrew
installation can coexist and make the parent command and its subprocesses
report or execute different versions. Do not hardcode one absolute binary to
work around this. Stop, record both paths and versions, and consolidate the
installations with explicit user approval before trusting dev/build evidence.

Re-run `command -v shopify`, `type -a shopify`, and `shopify version` after any
CLI command that reports an automatic upgrade. The upgrade uses the npm prefix
resolved by that process and can recreate a second global installation even
after a previous consolidation. On 2026-09-10, Homebrew CLI 4.8.0 passed both
app-configuration validations, the full SIT app build, and a cache-bypassed
Agent-store dev-preview check with the Dev Console connected. The older
NVM-owned 4.7.1 package was then removed with the user's approval.
`type -a shopify` now resolves only `/opt/homebrew/bin/shopify`, which reports
4.8.0.

For Shopify Function builds, Shopify CLI remains the platform-level validation
owner, while the extension's `extensions.build.command` owns compilation. Do
not weaken or delete valid app configuration merely to make an older or
inconsistent local CLI parser pass. Record that CLI validation as blocked,
retain the exact failure, and still run the configured compiler command and
Function behavior tests as separate local evidence.

This rule does not authorize deployment. The Shopify Deploy Rule still applies.

## 🔄 Deployment General Sync Rule

Deployment scripts run environment-specific general sync after Shopify deploy:
- Production: `npm run deployment:general-sync:prod` (loads `.env.prod`, connects to production database, enforces PROD proxy root `/apps/product-bundles` and validates PROD client ID `a383172f42c2ab283901a663d485a03d`).
- SIT / Staging: `npm run deployment:general-sync:sit` (loads `.env.staging`, connects to SIT database, enforces SIT proxy root `/apps/product-bundles-sit` and validates SIT client ID `63077bb0483a6ce08a2d6139b14d170b`).

Coding agents can invoke these scripts directly from the workspace root whenever bundle sync is required:

```bash
# To run general sync against PROD:
WPB_DEPLOYMENT_GENERAL_SYNC=true npm run deployment:general-sync:prod

# To run general sync against SIT / Staging:
WPB_DEPLOYMENT_GENERAL_SYNC=true npm run deployment:general-sync:sit
```

Both scripts are disabled by default and accept one primary true/false flag:

```bash
WPB_DEPLOYMENT_GENERAL_SYNC=true
```

When true, the script reads installed shops and saved bundles from Prisma, ensures
current metafield definitions, replays the normal save-time storefront sync,
and ensures FPB add-on discounts.
Update `apps/OnlyBundles-app/scripts/deployment-general-sync.*.ts` and its service/tests **only when**
the Prisma schema changes or the app's metafield/metaobject definitions or
value-writing contracts change. Do not edit it for routine feature, UI, or
deployment changes.

## ⚠️ Cart Transform Repair Rule

`npm run cart-transform:repair` runs an app-context Cart Transform repair for installed shops. It is disabled by default and accepts only these mode flags:

```bash
WPB_CART_TRANSFORM_REPAIR_DRY_RUN=true
WPB_CART_TRANSFORM_REPAIR_APPLY=true
```

Never set both flags. Dry-run scans installed shops without mutating Shopify. Apply mode runs `CartTransformService.completeSetup` through the app's offline Admin context for every installed shop.

---

## 📦 Node 22 Lockfile & Docker Sync Rule

The production Docker container (`node:22-alpine` in `Dockerfile`) and Render deployment execute `npm ci --omit=dev`.

Local macOS development environments frequently run newer Node and npm versions (e.g. Node 25 with npm 11). Running `npm install` on macOS with newer npm prunes cross-platform optional dependencies and WASM bindings — specifically `@emnapi/runtime@1.11.3` (required by `@img/sharp-wasm32` under `sharp`) and Linux musl/x64 optional packages — because darwin-arm64 does not activate them locally. This desynchronizes `package-lock.json` from declared `overrides`/`resolutions`, causing production Docker/Render builds to fail with:

```
npm error `npm ci` can only install packages when your package.json and package-lock.json or npm-shrinkwrap.json are in sync.
npm error Missing: @emnapi/runtime@1.11.3 from lock file
```

### Mandatory Lockfile Protocol

Whenever modifying dependencies, devDependencies, `overrides`, or `resolutions` in `package.json`, or whenever regenerating `package-lock.json`:

1. **Regenerate the lockfile with Node 22 (npm 10)**:
   ```bash
   nvm exec 22 npm install --package-lock-only
   ```
2. **Verify dry-run clean install passes under Node 22**:
   ```bash
   nvm exec 22 npm ci --dry-run --ignore-scripts
   nvm exec 22 npm ci --omit=dev --dry-run --ignore-scripts
   ```
   Both commands must exit with code `0`. Never commit `package-lock.json` if `npm ci` reports `EUSAGE` or missing packages.
3. **Verify `@emnapi/runtime` is present in `package-lock.json`**:
   ```bash
   grep -q '"node_modules/@emnapi/runtime"' package-lock.json || echo "ERROR: @emnapi/runtime missing"
   ```
4. **Banned patterns**:
   - Running `npm install` with Node > 22 and committing the pruned `package-lock.json` without verifying under Node 22.
   - Removing `@emnapi/runtime` from `resolutions`, `overrides`, or `package-lock.json` merely because a local linter, pruning script, or dead-code candidate generator (such as Knip on macOS) flags it as unused.

---

## 🧪 Local Process & Log Attachment Note

When a local dev command is launched from a shell session:

- Shell PID may be a wrapper (for example `/bin/zsh -il`), with the actual `shopify app dev` process as a child Node PID.
- In our environment, Node logging is attached to the parent terminal (`/dev/ttys006`) and local terminal I/O pipes; there is no dedicated rotating log file opened by default.
- For process troubleshooting, inspect the process tree first:
  - `ps -p <shell_pid>`
  - `pgrep -P <shell_pid>` (or equivalent child-process discovery)
  - `lsof -p <node_pid>`
- Avoid attempting unsafe TTY reads (`/dev/ttys*`) for background log capture.

**NEVER run repair apply mode autonomously.** Stop and ask for explicit user approval first. Warn the user that production apply mode can create or replace CartTransform objects and overwrite the `$app.runtime_token_secret` owner metafield across live merchant shops.

---

## 🧪 Shopify Dev Environment Rule

**NEVER run `npm run dev` autonomously.** The development server will always be provided by the user.

If asked or prompted about starting the dev environment, provide instructions only. Tell the user to start the SIT app config explicitly with the SIT TOML, not the standard PROD config:

```bash
npm run dev:sit
```

Do not run dev against `apps/OnlyBundles-app/shopify.web.toml` / the production Shopify app configuration.

Do not run `shopify app build` while `shopify app dev` is active. With the
global Shopify CLI 4.7.1, the standalone build can reuse and rewrite the active
`.shopify/dev-bundle` workspace instead of producing an independent deploy
bundle. The Admin Dev Console can then lose its **Connected** state even though
the CLI, Remix, and Cloudflare child processes remain alive, and the theme
extension preview can continue resolving an unpublished CDN handle. Stop the
dev process before a full app build; restart `npm run dev:sit` after the build
and open the preview emitted by that new session.

### Stale theme-extension preview handles

Restarting `npm run dev:sit` can leave an already-open storefront tab attached to
the previous Shopify theme-extension preview session. The visible product or
app-proxy URL can remain identical while Shopify resolves `asset_url` references
through an obsolete `/extensions/.../dev-<handle>/...` path.

Recognize this state by all of the following evidence:

- The embedded Admin dev console is connected to the new tunnel, but storefront
  theme-extension JS/CSS requests still use the earlier `dev-<handle>`.
- Those requests return `404` or `net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_ORB`.
- A deployed production extension asset may still load, so
  `window.__BUNDLE_WIDGET_VERSION__` reports an older version and the widget can
  remain on its loading surface.

Do not diagnose widget logic from that stale page, and do not rely on a normal
or cache-bypassed reload to replace the preview session. Open the bundle again
with the Admin **Preview Bundle** / **Preview in store** action, or open the
fresh storefront preview from the active Shopify CLI session (normally `p` in
the terminal). Then:

1. Clear Cache Storage and hard-reload with cache bypass.
2. Confirm the theme-extension `dev-<handle>` changed and its JS/CSS responses
   are `200`.
3. Confirm `window.__BUNDLE_WIDGET_VERSION__` matches the local build.
4. Confirm the bootstrap/loading marker clears before gathering storefront
   behavior or visual evidence.

A fresh Admin preview is a diagnostic, not a repair guarantee. Shopify can
render a new product document that still references the same invalid remote
`dev-<handle>`. If every asset under that handle returns Shopify's CDN 404
(Chrome reports `net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_ORB`) while the files exist in
`.shopify/dev-bundle`, the active remote dev preview is stale or incomplete.
Disabling the app embed does not repair it: a PPB app block loads its own assets
from the same theme-extension version. Stop the dev process, clean the SIT
preview with `shopify app dev clean --config
shopify.app.wolfpack-product-bundles-sit.toml`, restart with `npm run dev:sit`,
and open the CLI's fresh preview before repeating the cache-cleared checks. Do
not run `app dev clean` against a live dev process, and do not uninstall either
app to repair a preview handle.

Also check for duplicate app-embed metadata before trusting app-proxy evidence.
If both production and SIT app embeds are enabled on the same theme, the current
dev PPB block can render while the deployed production embed still issues its
own settings requests. Because both embeds publish shared storefront runtime
state, script load order can also make the current PPB widget use the other
environment's proxy root and remain hidden after bootstrap. Opening Preview
Bundle creates a new document and can change that order, so an apparently fixed
widget after that click is intermittent evidence—not proof that the earlier
product URL was stale. Inspect every `[data-wpb-app-embed]` owner and its proxy
root. Do not attribute a request from `/apps/product-bundles` to SIT when SIT
owns `/apps/product-bundles-sit`.

Do not uninstall the other app merely to switch test environments. Shopify owns
app-embed and app-block activation as theme configuration, while uninstalling
removes the app's theme resources and exercises a different lifecycle. Use this
environment-isolation order:

1. Prefer a separate Shopify dev/test store for each app environment.
2. When one store must host both apps concurrently, dedicate separate themes to
   them. A PROD theme contains only PROD app embeds and app blocks; an
   unpublished/development SIT theme contains only SIT app embeds and app
   blocks. Preview the selected theme explicitly.
3. When testing both apps sequentially on the same theme, disable the dormant
   app embed and remove or disable its app blocks before enabling the app under
   test. Save the theme, open the environment's current preview action, clear
   Cache Storage, and hard-reload with cache bypass.

Stopping `shopify app dev` does not clean its dev preview. Before switching from
a local SIT preview back to the released extension, use Shopify's **Clean dev
preview** action or run `shopify app dev clean` with the SIT app configuration.
This restores the app's released version; it is not a substitute for toggling
the correct theme embed, and it is not the same as uninstalling the app.

## 🔐 Shopify Expiring Offline Token Rule

Public apps must use Shopify expiring offline access tokens. Before changing auth, session storage, background Admin API clients, app-proxy Admin API callers, or install/reauthorization code, check the official Shopify offline token docs:
`https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/authentication-authorization/access-tokens/offline-access-tokens`

Required checks:
- Offline token acquisition and migration requests to `/admin/oauth/access_token` must include `expiring=1`.
- Persist `expires`, `refreshToken`, and `refreshTokenExpiresAt` for offline sessions.
- Session storage must never return a non-expiring offline session to Admin API callers. Legacy offline rows with no refresh token must be migrated first, or withheld if migration fails.
- Background Admin API work must use `unauthenticated.admin(shopDomain)` or `getOfflineSessionForShop(...)`; do not read `Session.accessToken` directly from Prisma.
- Token refresh must use `grant_type=refresh_token` and persist the newly returned access token, refresh token, and expiration metadata.
- Add or update focused behavior tests for any auth/session change that could reintroduce non-expiring offline tokens.

---

## 🧪 Admin LCP Debug Bridge Rule

For major Admin UI changes, recreate and use the temporary Admin LCP debug bridge in dev/SIT to optimize route-level LCP before relying on Shopify field data.

Reference implementation and notes:
- Diagnostics runtime: `apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/lib/admin-web-vitals-diagnostics.client.ts`
- Operating doc: `internal docs/Operations/Admin Performance.md`

Expected dev workflow:
1. Enable debug mode with `?wpbWebVitalsDebug=1` on the embedded Shopify Admin app URL.
2. Use the iframe `postMessage` bridge to read route-local samples when cross-origin iframe access blocks direct inspection.
3. Clear samples before each fresh route pass.
4. Measure the exact route and LCP candidate after every major Admin UI change.
5. Treat the bridge as dev/SIT diagnostic tooling only; Shopify Admin field metrics remain the source of truth for Built for Shopify.

Do not keep the bridge in committed runtime code after the measurement cycle. If the bridge has been removed after a prior optimization cycle, recreate it temporarily from the documented pattern before the next major Admin UI performance pass, then remove it again before shipping. Do not recreate app-owned server-side Web Vitals persistence or `/api/web-vitals` telemetry.

---

## 🔧 Widget Bundle Build Process

**ALWAYS build after modifying the source graph rooted at these entrypoints:**

Widget sources → `npm run build:widgets`:
- `apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/storefront/full-page.ts`
- `apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/storefront/product-page.ts`
- `apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/storefront/app-embed.ts`
- their imports under `apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/assets/`

SDK sources → `npm run build:sdk`:
- `apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/storefront/sdk.ts`
- its imports under `apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/assets/sdk/`
- Output: `apps/OnlyBundles-app/extensions/bundle-builder/assets/wolfpack-bundles-sdk.js`

**Build commands:**
```bash
npm run build:widgets           # all widget bundles + minify
npm run build:widgets:full-page
npm run build:widgets:product-page
npm run build:sdk
```

The raw storefront sources are TypeScript, so `npm run typecheck` validates
them. After building, run `node --check` against the generated JavaScript that
Shopify will serve:

Examples:
```bash
node --check apps/OnlyBundles-app/extensions/bundle-builder/assets/bundle-widget-full-page-bundled.js
node --check apps/OnlyBundles-app/extensions/bundle-builder/assets/bundle-widget-product-page-bundled.js
node --check apps/OnlyBundles-app/extensions/bundle-builder/assets/bundle-app-embed.js
node --check apps/OnlyBundles-app/extensions/bundle-builder/assets/wolfpack-bundles-sdk.js
```

**Forgetting to build = changes won't appear in the storefront.**

## 🗜️ Asset Minification

Always edit raw source CSS files, then run minifier:

Raw sources:
- `apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/assets/widgets/full-page-css/bundle-widget-full-page.css`
- `apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/assets/widgets/product-page-css/bundle-widget.css`

Minified output (deploy target):
- `apps/OnlyBundles-app/extensions/bundle-builder/assets/bundle-widget-full-page.css`
- `apps/OnlyBundles-app/extensions/bundle-builder/assets/bundle-widget.css`

| Change type | Command |
|---|---|
| JS bundle changes | `npm run build:widgets` |
| CSS-only changes | `npm run minify:assets css` |
| Both CSS and JS | `npm run build:widgets && npm run minify:assets css` |
| All assets | `npm run minify:assets` |

Script exits non-zero if any CSS file exceeds Shopify's **100,000 B** app-block asset limit.

---

## 🔢 Widget Version Rule

Increment `WIDGET_VERSION` in `apps/OnlyBundles-app/scripts/build-storefront.mjs` before every widget deploy.

| Change type | Version bump |
|---|---|
| Bug fix | PATCH x.y.Z |
| New feature (backwards-compatible) | MINOR x.Y.z |
| Breaking change / redesign | MAJOR X.y.z |

**Steps before every widget deploy:**
1. Increment `WIDGET_VERSION`
2. `npm run build:widgets`
3. `npm run minify:assets css`
4. Commit source + bundled files
5. Run `npm run deploy:prod` or `npm run deploy:sit`
6. Wait 2–10 min for Shopify CDN cache propagation

Verify live version: `console.log(window.__BUNDLE_WIDGET_VERSION__)` in DevTools console.

Shopify CDN cache-busting: the `?v=HASH` param on `asset_url` only changes on `shopify app deploy`. Custom query params are NOT on the CDN allowlist.

Storefront asset strategy: theme/app-extension Liquid must load storefront JS/CSS with Shopify `asset_url`. Do not use `/apps/product-bundles/assets/...` as the production storefront JS/CSS loading path; app proxy is for signed API/data routes only.

---

## 🚨 Do Not Touch — Bundle Config Loading (FPB Widget)

**NEVER modify the bundle config loading priority order in `loadBundleData()`.**

Two-stage load strategy:
1. **Stage 1 — App-proxy document marker (primary):** The signed `/wpb/{publicNumber}` route writes the complete, source-marked config into `data-bundle-config`. Widget reads it on init without a second bundle request.
2. **Stage 2 — Proxy API fallback:** If the marker is absent, empty, malformed, or does not match the current bundle, fall back to `GET /apps/product-bundles/api/bundle/{id}.json` with one retry after 3s for `503`/`504` (Render cold-starts).

**Rules:**
- ❌ Do NOT remove or reorder the source-marked `data-bundle-config` check — it must run before the fallback fetch
- ❌ Do NOT remove `503`/`504` retry logic — Render cold-starts are 3–10s
- ❌ Do NOT add a third source between Stage 1 and Stage 2
- ✅ If bundle config structure changes, update server writer AND widget parser together

**Relevant files:**
- Widget: `apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/assets/widgets/full-page/methods/analytics-config-methods.ts` — `loadBundleData()`
- App-proxy document: `apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/routes/root/wpb.$bundleId.tsx` — source-marked `data-bundle-config`
- Formatter: `apps/OnlyBundles-app/app/lib/bundle-formatter.server.ts`

## 🔐 Test Store Access

- Store: `wolfpack-store-test-1.myshopify.com`
- Default storefront password: `1`

## 🧭 Chrome DevTools App Verification

Use only direct Chrome DevTools MCP tools (`mcp__chrome_devtools__*`) for all browser investigation, interaction, evidence gathering, responsive testing, and implementation verification. Do not use browser plugins, browser-control wrappers, Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium, or alternate browser automation tools as substitutes. If direct Chrome DevTools MCP is unavailable or stalls, report the browser verification as blocked rather than switching tools.

For responsive testing, resize the actual Chrome window with the Chrome
DevTools `resize_page` tool. Do not use custom viewport emulation, device
emulation, browser zoom, CSS scaling, or JavaScript overrides to simulate a
smaller screen. Custom viewport shrinking can make the Shopify Admin shell and
embedded app iframe behave differently from a genuinely resized browser window
and creates misleading screenshots. Restore the Chrome window to the required
desktop dimensions before desktop verification.

Access embedded app via Shopify Admin URL:
```
https://admin.shopify.com/store/wolfpack-store-test-1/apps/wolfpack-product-bundles-sit/app/...
```
Do NOT use Cloudflare tunnel URLs directly — they redirect to `/auth/login`.

## graphify

Knowledge graph at `graphify-out/`, internal docs vault at `internal docs/`.

### Mandatory Search Order

1. **`internal docs/`** — start here for Cart Transform, Pricing, DB schema, Shopify API limits, widget architecture, deployment.
2. **`graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md`** — god nodes and community structure.
3. **`graphify-out/wiki/`** — node-level detail.
4. **Raw source files** — ONLY when vault and graph don't cover the detail.

❌ Do NOT open raw `.ts`/`.js`/`.liquid`/`.prisma` files speculatively.

### Keeping the Vault Current

If you learn something about Shopify API behaviour, gotchas, data model details, or build rules that's NOT in `internal docs/` → write/update the note and add link in `internal docs/index.md`.

### Graph-Assisted Debugging & RCA

1. Find affected node's community in `GRAPH_REPORT.md`.
2. Run `graphify path "NodeA" "NodeB"` to trace relationship chains.
3. Check **Surprising Connections** and **Hyperedges** sections.

```bash
graphify path "ComponentA" "ComponentB"
graphify query "what depends on X?"
```

### Impact Analysis — Mandatory Before Every Change

1. Identify god nodes in `GRAPH_REPORT.md` — changes touching these require extra care.
2. Find all nodes depending on what you're changing.
3. Document blast radius in **commit message body** and **PR description**:

```
[issue-id] type: short description

Impact: touches <CommunityName>, depends on <GodNode>
Affected: <file1>, <file2>
Tested by: <test-file(s)>
```

PR Impact Analysis section:
```markdown
## Impact Analysis
- **Communities touched**: [list]
- **God nodes affected**: [list]
- **Downstream risk**: [what could break]
- **Test coverage**: [test files]
```

### Keeping the Graph Current

After modifying code files, run:
```bash
npm run graphify:rebuild
```

## 🔗 EB Help Links — Read Before Every Implementation

Before implementing any EB feature, click and read **every** "How to setup" and "Learn More" link visible on any relevant card or feature in the EB app.

**Why:** These links contain precise setup instructions, field explanations, and behavior details that are not visible from the UI alone. Skipping them means implementing based on guesswork.

**Rules:**
- ✅ Click every help/learn-more link on the relevant card or feature page before writing any code
- ✅ If the link opens a **popup** (overlay/modal inside the EB app) — read the full popup content before dismissing
- ✅ If the link opens a **new tab** (external website or docs page) — fetch and read the full page content via `WebFetch`
- ❌ Do NOT start implementation until all available help links for that feature have been read
- ❌ Do NOT assume the UI alone is sufficient — help content routinely reveals hidden fields, constraints, and sequencing requirements

**Workflow:**
1. Navigate to the relevant EB card/page in Chrome DevTools MCP
2. `take_snapshot()` — identify all "How to setup", "Learn More", "?" or similar link text
3. Click each link; screenshot and read popup content OR `WebFetch` the opened URL
4. Document any new facts discovered in `internal docs/EB Implementation Reference.md`
5. Only then proceed to implementation

## 🎯 EB Implementation Reference — Grounded Truth for Porting

When implementing any feature that mirrors EB behaviour — step/category data shapes, admin API payloads, template IDs, storefront runtime globals, cart add format, box selection enforcement, or text config — **consult `internal docs/EB Implementation Reference.md` first.**

This doc is the distilled, topic-organized reference captured from a live authenticated EB investigation. Do NOT guess EB's data shapes — they are fully documented there.

### What it covers

| Topic | What's documented |
|---|---|
| Admin API endpoints | All FPB + PPB create/update/save paths |
| FPB step/category payload | Complete JSON shape including `categoryType`, product ID arrays, collection GIDs |
| PPB step/category payload | Complete JSON shape including `conditions`, `displayVariantsAsIndividualProducts`, `displayVariantsAsSwatches` |
| Discount configuration | `discountConfiguration` + compact `metafieldData.discount` mirror |
| Default/preselected products | `defaultProductsData` full shape |
| Template system | FPB two-field (`bundleDesignTemplate` + `bundleDesignPresetId`) — all 4 presets confirmed; PPB two-field (`bundleDesignTemplate` + `templateId`) — all 4 templates confirmed |
| Storefront globals | FPB `window.gbb.*` + `stepsConfigurationData`; PPB `window.gbbMix.*` + `mixAndMatchBundleSettings` (25+ fields) |
| Cart add format | FPB JSON + PPB multipart; `_wolfpackProductBundle:OfferId` format; `bundle_details` metafield accumulation |
| Box selection | `gbbBoxSelection.state` schema; ATC enforcement logic (decompiled); DOM structure |
| Text config | `bundleTextConfig.bundleSummary.{title,subTitle}` — confirmed only two fields |
| Collection pagination | Batch `nodes(ids:[...])` architecture — NOT cursor-based |
| Wolfpack DB alignment | Field-by-field mapping from EB payload → Wolfpack model |

### Mandatory search order for EB porting questions

1. `internal docs/EB Implementation Reference.md` — confirmed facts, exact JSON shapes
2. `docs/competitor-analysis/16-eb-full-data-flow-investigation.md` — full evidence record with raw payloads, decompiled JS, and DOM captures
3. Only then: live DevTools investigation if the reference doc has a gap

❌ Do NOT assume or fabricate EB data shapes — they are documented.
❌ Do NOT re-investigate facts already in the reference doc.

## 📱 Storefront UI Audit — Desktop + Mobile

When auditing storefront UI, test **both viewports**:
1. Desktop screenshot (1280×800+)
2. Mobile screenshot (resize the actual Chrome window to 390×844)
3. Report findings for both

Before gathering evidence or verifying any storefront asset/UI implementation, empty/bypass the browser cache and hard reload the storefront in Chrome. This applies after source, build, or deploy changes and before every storefront UI review (Chrome DevTools MCP: `navigate_page` reload with `ignoreCache: true`; also clear Cache Storage via `caches.keys()` when available). Do not trust a normal refresh for storefront parity checks or implementation verification.

Before testing any implemented storefront change in Chrome, always refresh the relevant storefront tab first, then verify the changed behaviour or appearance. Do not test against an already-open tab without refreshing after the implementation/build step.

Required for: "audit the storefront", "check the UI", post-deploy verification, appearance bug reports.

---

## 🔬 Competitor Parity Audit Rule

For any "parity", "compare", "match competitor" request — conduct a full audit before writing code.

**Parity means:** pixel-level placement, visual hierarchy, spacing (measured via `getComputedStyle`), UX interactions, edge cases.

**Audit workflow:**
1. Open competitor in Chrome DevTools MCP, take full-page screenshot
2. Use `take_snapshot` for DOM structure, `evaluate_script` for computed styles
3. Interact (click, hover, toggle) and screenshot each state
4. If CORS blocks `evaluate_script` — use `take_snapshot` + keyboard interactions
5. Document every gap (placement, size, color, spacing, behavior)
6. Implement only after audit is complete

❌ Do NOT estimate spacing — measure it. ❌ Do NOT skip mobile for storefront parity. ❌ Do NOT implement partial parity.

## 🖱️ Chrome DevTools — Shopify Admin Iframe Interaction

The Shopify Admin embeds the app in a cross-origin OOPIF — `contentDocument` is null from the outer page.

### Page Switching

When switching Chrome DevTools pages with `select_page`, omit `bringToFront` or set it to `false`. Never use `bringToFront: true`.

### PRIMARY METHOD — Keyboard Tab Navigation

Try Tab navigation BEFORE `evaluate_script`. The CDP accessibility tree traverses cross-origin iframes.

1. `take_snapshot()` — find interactive elements (button, textbox, checkbox) inside iframe
2. `click(uid: "...")` — click a safe interactive element to bring focus into iframe
3. `press_key(key: "Tab")` / `press_key(key: "Shift+Tab")` — navigate to target
4. `press_key(key: "Enter")` (buttons/links) or `press_key(key: "Space")` (checkboxes/toggles) — activate
5. `take_screenshot()` — verify result

If nav items are `StaticText` nodes (no ARIA role), use arrow keys or fall back to CDP target method.

### FALLBACK — `evaluate_script` via CDP target

Use when the app's own iframe registers as a separate CDP target in `list_pages`.

1. `list_pages()` — find iframe's pageId
2. `select_page(pageId: "...")` — switch to iframe target
3. `evaluate_script(script: "document.querySelector('...').click()")` — interact
4. `take_screenshot()` — verify
5. `select_page(pageId: "<admin-page-id>")` — switch back

Always `select_page` to the **iframe target** before `evaluate_script`. For third-party CORS-blocked iframes, use Tab navigation instead.
