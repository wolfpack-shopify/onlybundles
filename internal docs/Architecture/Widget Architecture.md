# Widget Architecture

## Two Widgets

| Widget                 | Source file                                | Bundle output                                                            | Shopify block                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Full-Page Bundle (FPB) | `app/assets/bundle-widget-full-page.ts`    | `extensions/bundle-builder/assets/bundle-widget-full-page-bundled.js`    | `bundle-app-embed.liquid` on the app-proxy document |
| Product-Page (PDP)     | `app/assets/bundle-widget-product-page.ts` | `extensions/bundle-builder/assets/bundle-widget-product-page-bundled.js` | `bundle-product-page.liquid`                        |

Shared runtime modules live under `app/assets/widgets/shared/`. Controllers, method modules, and template modules import each shared primitive directly from its owning module. The removed `bundle-widget-components` compatibility barrel must not be recreated: direct ownership lets esbuild close every method over real lexical bindings and prevents browser-only free-global failures. TypeScript entry points under `app/storefront/` import the required runtime graph, and esbuild resolves, tree-shakes, minifies, and emits browser IIFEs. Storefronts never load raw ESM source files.

FPB, PPB, and SDK config selection pass the selected public bundle through the
shared locale projector before exposing step, category, add-on, pricing,
widget, embed, and general text fields to their existing renderers. Locale
matching is case-insensitive, prefers the exact Shopify locale, then its base
language, and finally retains the base configured copy. The projector is
immutable and does not change the FPB Shopify-snapshot-only load contract.
Subscription copy is excluded because its dedicated storefront
resolver already performs exact/base locale resolution and deep-merges plan
copy. Pricing projection includes the localized global success message as well
as per-rule messages, progress tiers, and bundle-quantity labels. The dedicated
PPB Bundle Embed selector follows the same case-insensitive exact/base matching
and ignores blank overrides so its title and subtitle retain configured base
copy.

Template behavior is resolved through plain config modules and method modules:

- FPB configs: `app/assets/widgets/full-page/templates/{standard,classic,compact,horizontal}.config.ts`
- PPB configs: `app/assets/widgets/product-page/templates/{grid,list,horizontal-slots,vertical-slots}.config.ts`
- Registries resolve canonical app template identifiers to those target template configs. FPB Standard is stored and emitted as `STANDARD`.

## PPB modal-template picker ownership

PPB Horizontal Slots (`PDP_MODAL/MODAL`) and Vertical Slots (`PDP_MODAL/SIMPLIFIED`) share the single `#bundle-builder-modal` picker owned by `product-page/methods/dom-methods.ts`. Product List and Product Grid use their in-page surfaces and must not inherit modal-only layout behavior.

The shared picker is an 85dvh bottom sheet with three regions: a non-scrolling header, the only vertically scrolling catalog body, and a non-scrolling footer in normal flex flow. On desktop the header is content-driven within a 128px-to-160px viewport-responsive range, leaving the catalog enough height at the supported 1280×800 minimum for complete card actions and focus rings before the footer boundary. Footer geometry must never overlap product actions or focus rings. The catalog renders five tracks at 1440px, four at 1280px, and two at 768px and below; fixed track counts keep sparse rows from stretching. The desktop close control must remain above the later-painted tabs wrapper so its complete 44px target receives pointer input; changing that stacking order can leave a visible but inert X. Modal lifecycle and exact opener-focus restoration remain owned by `modal-state-methods.ts`, while the global keyboard listener contains Tab focus only when the picker is the topmost drawer layer.

All four PPB templates and all four FPB templates resolve grouped-variant presentation from the active
category's canonical `variantSelectorMode`: Dropdown, Pills, Color swatches, or
Image swatches. Each Shopify option dimension owns one visible label and one
selector group in canonical option order. Dropdown groups use labeled native
selects; groups presented as non-dropdown controls use uniquely named native
radios. In a multi-dimensional Color swatches or Image swatches configuration,
a dimension without the requested canonical Shopify swatch kind uses one
labeled native select while mapped dimensions retain the configured swatch
radios. Explicit Dropdown and Pills modes remain unchanged. Repeated card,
modal, and picker instances receive instance-scoped IDs and group names.
Unavailable values remain present and disabled rather than being filtered for
fit. Color and image swatches use Shopify Storefront API
`ProductOptionValue.swatch` data matched through each variant's
`selectedOptions`. Missing Shopify swatches retain a neutral labeled
presentation for a single swatch dimension; in multi-dimensional swatch mode an
entirely unmapped dimension uses the compact native-select presentation. The
runtime does not infer colors or substitute variant images.
The FPB product-details modal uses the same canonical resolver, so color-like
labels such as `Black` remain text controls unless Shopify supplies a swatch.
Cached product snapshots that lack canonical option values and selected options
are rehydrated before a swatch selector renders. Optional color tooltips are
described to keyboard focus, clamp/flip at viewport edges on precise pointers,
and are replaced by a
persistent selected-value label on coarse/mobile pointers. The existing
delegated change path updates the active card variant, price, image, and
inventory context; Add remains the bundle-selection mutation. The modal focus
trap queries native interactive controls as one combined selector so results
stay in document order and variant radios remain keyboard reachable. A variant
rerender restores focus to the replacement selected radio without scrolling,
preserving arrow-key exploration and its focus tooltip.

FPB persists those modes through the existing `StepCategory` fields and emits
them in the storefront category contract. For a two-dimensional pill or swatch
mode, the primary or canonically mapped dimension remains a visible native-radio
group and every additional dimension becomes one labeled native select. FPB
Dropdown mode retains complete-variant selection and its existing mobile policy.
The shared product-card renderer always creates a selector region; when any card
in the current grid renders a configured selector, sibling cards reserve that
region alongside their independent media, identity, price, and action regions.
The renderer owns one semantic and visual order for every selector mode:
selector controls precede the variant price, which precedes the Add or quantity
action. Template CSS may change card direction or action geometry, but cannot
move pricing or the primary action ahead of the selector region.
Every FPB control keeps unavailable variants or values present with disabled semantics.
Presentation changes delegate exactly one update through the existing product
card or product-details owner, which remains responsible for variant identity,
price, image, inventory, quantity clamping, summary state, and Add eligibility.

Horizontal/Vertical modal cards keep these grouped-variant selectors inline at
every viewport. Product images and titles are informational and do not open a
nested product-details surface. A pure PPB modal-card presentation helper
resolves `add`, `quantity`, or `maximum-reached` from per-product quantity
validation. At maximum the localized `Added xN` action removes the full
selected quantity. These overrides ignore `showQuantitySelectorOnCard` only for
modal cards; Product List/Grid retain their in-page behavior.

Filled Horizontal slots remain bounded by the existing responsive tile block-size token, while filled Vertical slots use the existing responsive row block-size as both their minimum and maximum. Product names wrap and visually clamp only within that boundary; their complete value remains in the DOM and the product-specific accessible name of the overlaid cross-badge remove control. The cross badge keeps a 44px interaction target, stops propagation so it cannot open replacement, and uses the existing single-removal and same-index focus-recovery paths.

Template installer/prototype patch functions have been removed. Widget entry files compose exported template method objects in the same central `Object.assign` used for controller method modules.

The widgets do not accept the retired `individualSellingPlanSelection` field.
FPB and PPB instead consume the explicit public `subscription` object from
`bundle_ui_config`. A shared purchase-options component renders the selected
selling-plan group across every FPB and PPB template. Subscription submissions add the
same `selling_plan` to every component line and omit the merged-path public
`Box` metadata; one-time submissions retain the existing merged-parent flow.

## Admin Design Production Renderer Adapter

Settings -> Design resolves its eight template selections through
`mapTemplateSelection`, converts unsaved values with
`buildSettingsDesignRuntime`, and sends them to the isolated
`/settings-design-preview-frame` document through a versioned same-origin
protocol. The frame dynamically imports only the selected production FPB or PPB
controller and loads the same base, responsive, and template CSS sources used by
the storefront asset build.

Protocol version 2 separates the persistent editable area from transient
preview state. Bundle header, navigation, categories, product cards, product
slots, and cart/summary are template-filtered edit areas. Default, product
picker, loading, validation, and upsell are independently filtered preview
states. Upsell is FPB-only because it renders the external FPB product-page
offer; PPB templates do not expose a synthetic equivalent. Choosing an area
returns to Default; choosing a temporary state retains the previous area so
closing or resetting the state restores the same editing context. No version-1
surface compatibility path is retained.

The FPB frame initializes its mount with the same
`bundle-widget-container bundle-widget-full-page` host classes as the app-embed
storefront document before the controller renders. These are functional style
scope owners, not decorative aliases: the shared responsive grid, template
columns, and inline summary rules depend on them. PPB retains the host classes
owned by its production controller.

FPB category identity has one visual owner at a time. When category tabs are
enabled, the selected tab is the active-category label and the standalone
category title is omitted during both initial rendering and step navigation.
The standalone title remains available only when category tabs are disabled.
Because Settings -> Design runs the production controller, this rule is shared
by its preview and the deployed storefront widget.

Deterministic fixture bundles hydrate the controller without Shopify, app-proxy,
or storefront requests. Controller persistence, analytics, add-to-cart,
post-cart behavior, and external navigation are disabled; links, forms, and cart
actions are also blocked at the frame boundary. Interactions otherwise use the
production renderer. Product picker, Loading, Validation, and Upsell use their
real modal, overlay, toast, and offer implementations.

The frame must initialize the same explicit Shopify currency globals that its
production controllers receive from Liquid: `shopCurrency`,
`shopifyMultiCurrency.shopBaseCurrency`,
`shopifyMultiCurrency.customerCurrency`,
`__WOLFPACK_PRESENTMENT_CURRENCY__`, and `Shopify.currency`. The deterministic
preview uses one requested currency with rate `1.0`; it must not rely on a
storefront fallback. The controller subclass also retains and awaits the exact
Promise started by the base constructor's virtual `init()` call. A derived
class field cannot own that Promise because its initializer runs after
`super()` and would erase the constructor-started value, exposing a partially
initialized controller to later preview effects.

The FPB Upsell preview uses a deterministic production-shaped block offer after
the local product purchase form and delegates its markup to
`renderFpbUpsellOffers`. Its action background, action text, border, and body
text consume the same generated `--bundle-upsell-*` variables as the deployed
offer, so unsaved Design values and storefront output share one token contract.

In Default state, the frame scrolls the selected production region into view
and applies a preview-only focus attribute. The frame-owned stylesheet renders
a persistent outline and localized `Editing` label without altering production
widget CSS or intercepting storefront interactions. Temporary states suspend
the region focus; validation remains visible while selected and product-picker
dismissal is reported to the parent so the state selector returns to Default.

The frame supplies an adaptive neutral store shell: FPB is presented in a
full-page collection context, while PPB is presented beside product media and
product information. This context is intentionally theme-neutral; bundle DOM,
styling, responsive behavior, and interactions remain production-owned. The
logical desktop renderer remains 1280×1136, while its gutterless stage uses the
preview-column width to establish the same aspect ratio. Releasing the inspector
column therefore enlarges the rendered storefront instead of leaving unused
canvas space. The mobile renderer remains exactly 390×844 and is wrapped outside
the iframe by a 428×882 decorative iPhone 14 Pro footprint adapted from the
MIT-licensed Devices.css geometry. The frame adds its chrome around the full
renderer instead of reducing or cropping the iframe viewport. Fit calculation
includes that body without changing the storefront breakpoint. Both modes stay
centered within the available stage. The preview-frame document keeps its root
vertical scrolling behavior but suppresses root scrollbar chrome so the live
storefront remains scrollable without drawing a browser scrollbar inside the
device body.
Field-to-surface focus remains a one-shot request per edit so later manual
surface selection stays authoritative.

The separate storefront Preview Bundle action consumes saved Design settings
only. It lists active or unlisted bundles with a valid storefront identifier,
reserves a browser tab synchronously, and posts the existing authenticated
configure `/prepare-preview` route. FPB navigates to the signed shareable URL;
PPB appends the returned preview token to the parent product URL. Preparation
failure closes the reserved tab and leaves the Polaris modal open with an error.
The reserved `about:blank` tab must retain its opener connection while that
asynchronous request completes so the initiating Admin document can still
navigate it. Assign the validated storefront or Theme Editor destination first,
then immediately clear `opener`; clearing it during reservation strands a blank
tab and the later fallback open is susceptible to the browser's popup blocker.

PPB preview placement is verified with Shopify's Admin App API
`shopify.app.extensions()` result for the current app. The gate matches the
`bundle-product-page` activation target to the bundle product's effective
product template before opening the storefront URL. Do not infer ownership by
comparing the app-name segment stored in theme JSON with
`currentAppInstallation.app.handle`: Shopify can emit different values there,
including during dev preview. The setup path remains Shopify's canonical Theme
Editor deep link using the app API key and block handle.

Each app-embed runtime reads the `data-wpb-app-embed` marker immediately before
its own compiled script. A global first-marker query is not an ownership signal:
PROD and SIT can both be installed on the same theme and each emits a marker and
script. The runtime falls back to a document query only when exactly one marker
exists; an ambiguous document without an adjacent owner fails closed.

The Design workspace is preview-first: template, component surface, and logical
desktop/mobile selectors stay with the canvas, while one inspector exposes only
settings mapped to the visible component. Desktop merchants can collapse that
inspector from a Polaris boundary chevron so the fit-scaled canvas consumes the
released width; disclosure state is local and does not reset the preview or
unsaved values. ResizeObserver updates are coalesced into one browser-frame
style write without React render state or scale transitions. Phones hide the
boundary control and switch between Preview and
Customize panes without duplicating the preview model. Component color controls
have no Expert-mode gate. `inheritedColorFieldKeys` records which fields resolve
from the first Storefront API Shop Brand primary or secondary pair; editing a
field removes it from that list and reset restores it. Existing saved payloads
without the list remain explicit. `buildSettingsDesignRuntime` and the
Shopify-synchronized `$app.ppb_storefront_css` value use the same pure resolver,
so Admin and storefront
precedence is explicit component value, Shop Brand semantic pair, then canonical
template default.

The store-level product-slot image is persisted inside the shared Design JSON,
not as direct `DesignSettings` columns. `stylePresets.images.slotIconUrl` and
`slotIconFit` feed both local previews and generated storefront CSS for all four
FPB and all four PPB templates. `badge` replaces the native centered plus icon;
`cover` fills the responsive slot; `fit` contains the image within it. Admin
labels `badge` as Centered badge and recommends a transparent 96 x 96 px square;
Fit recommends an 800 x 800 px square. The generated CSS variables are the
store-level authority when a slot image is configured, so older bundle-level
placeholder markup cannot override its presentation.

Source module names should describe their storefront responsibility. Avoid mechanical names such as `chunk-01.js` or `part-01.css`; those hide ownership and make stale widget code harder to spot.

The FPB-only Bundle Product Modal owns the product image carousel, name,
description, variant controls when needed, quantity, and Add To Box. Direct
product and collection hydration preserve up to 50 Shopify product images in
source order. One image renders without navigation; multiple distinct images
enable previous/next controls on desktop and horizontal swipe navigation in the
mobile drawer. The same shared component owns both responsive surfaces.
When explicit-step data and collection hydration produce the same selectable
variant, deduplication merges the records instead of keeping the first payload
unchanged. The merged record preserves the richer image gallery, description,
and variant inventory metadata so an earlier compact step record cannot disable
the shared carousel. A direct product whose metafield payload contains only a
compact single-image record is also hydrated through the existing storefront
products endpoint before rendering; product identifiers may arrive in `id`,
`selectionId`, or `productId`, and must resolve to the same product lookup key.

Because the FPB product-details overlay is mounted under `document.body`, its responsive surface is viewport-owned rather than widget-container-owned. FPB product cards explicitly opt into the shared card's image/title details affordance; PPB cards do not render that affordance or construct the product-details overlay.

While product details are open, the storefront document root and body are both
scroll-locked. The modal or drawer remains the only vertical scroll owner, and
overscroll must not chain into the storefront page behind it.

The shared multi-step FPB timeline sizes its navigation track from the rendered step count and caps it to the available shell width, so additional steps remain evenly spaced without pushing a two-step timeline to opposite page edges. Its 44px circular icon frame keeps the step image at its intrinsic aspect ratio, bounded by the available width and height with `object-fit: contain` and a small inner inset, so merchant images do not overflow or clip. Active icon emphasis is painted as an inset ring over the same reserved border box used by inactive icons; changing timeline state must not resize the inner icon.

PPB Product List (`PDP_INPAGE + CASCADE`) owns its multi-step navigation in the Product Page layout, footer, and validation method modules. A multi-step Product List renders only `currentStepIndex`; intermediate primary actions navigate Next after current-step validation, the final step uses Add Bundle to Cart, and Back preserves selections across steps. Single-step Product List and the other PPB templates keep their existing rendering paths. Product List exact-rule over-selection is blocked before state mutation so the current step and selected-items drawer remain stable.

PPB drawer ownership is explicit through `data-ppb-drawer-surface` values for
`selected-summary`, `bundle-picker`, and, where still used by in-page templates,
`variant-selector`.
The selected summary belongs to widget flow and never participates in document
scroll locking. The modal surfaces share the drawer layer manager: only
the top layer owns Escape and backdrop dismissal, document scroll locks once
across nested overlays, the root reserves its existing scrollbar gutter while
locked, and the final close restores the prior scroll styles and gutter value.
Horizontal/Vertical variants remain native and inline on both viewport classes.
Focus returns to the originating slot or variant trigger after the
owning layer closes.

FPB product grids do not pre-disable or dim unselected cards when a step reaches its exact or maximum quantity. Returning to a completed step keeps the full product set interactive; an attempted increase beyond the configured rule is rejected by `validateStepCondition` before selection state changes, and the rule toast explains the limit.

Quantity, Amount, and Weight step rules share the same selection and navigation
gates in both storefront widgets. Quantity sums selected units, Amount sums
variant prices in cents against merchant-entered currency-unit thresholds, and
Weight sums Shopify variant weights normalized to grams. Metric lookup follows
the selected variant ID into grouped-product variant data; it must not fall back
to the card's default variant or treat an unmatched nested variant as zero.
Rule toasts resolve the matching metric and operator language field before
substituting `{{conditionQuantity}}`, `{{conditionAmount}}`, or
`{{conditionWeight}}`.

Before PPB category-as-step expansion, the runtime removes steps whose persisted `enabled` value is `false`. This visibility normalization also applies when category expansion is off, so a disabled Admin step can never render or prevent a single enabled multi-category step from expanding into navigable category steps.

Product Page inventory normalization preserves `sourceVariantCount` after unavailable variants are filtered. Product List uses that metadata only when a grouped product originally had multiple variants but now has one sellable variant: the shared row shows the surviving variant title as static identity while keeping the selector absent. Fully unavailable products and unavailable options remain filtered.

FPB and PPB low-stock alerts consume the same Shopify Storefront API variant
fields already used by selection and cart guards: `quantityAvailable`,
`currentlyNotInStock`, and `availableForSale`. The public bundle DTO exposes one
per-bundle `lowStockAlert` object with `enabled`, `threshold`, and tokenized
`message`. The shared decision helper shows a claim only for a positive exact
sellable quantity at or below the threshold. Unknown quantity, zero stock,
unavailable variants, continue-selling/backorder variants, and failed or stale
reads suppress the claim. Out-of-stock UI remains a separate state, and Shopify
cart/checkout validation remains authoritative. Aggregate calculations use the
minimum `floor(quantityAvailable / requiredQuantity)` across required selected
component variants; optional components are ignored. Parent bundle inventory is
never read or synthesized.

---

## Storefront Surfaces

- Theme Editor exposes one FPB body app embed: `bundle-app-embed` (`Wolfpack Bundle`). It is the activation/status surface and hydrates the canonical app-proxy marker. The retired `bundle-full-page` Page block is not part of the extension contract.
- Embedded Admin status comes only from `shopify.app.extensions()` published-theme data. Server loaders do not parse `settings_data.json` or provide a status fallback. Theme Editor uses the documented `themes/current` `activateAppId` deep link.
- FPB and embed/page-builder product, collection, and cart-metafield requests use
  the signed `/apps/product-bundles` app proxy. The parent-product PPB block is
  the deliberate exception: it uses the synchronized public Storefront token
  and calls the shop's Storefront API directly, so its buyer path remains
  available without the Wolfpack web service.
- Parent-product PPB rendering continues to use the `bundle-product-page` app
  block. Greenfield Bundle Embed rendering is separately owned by the global
  `bundle-app-embed` runtime: it resolves an eligible PPB, lazily loads PPB
  assets, exposes that extension instance's Shopify-hosted
  `$app.ppb_storefront_runtime` and Liquid currency context, and mounts before
  the primary visible Add to Cart control. The
  `bundle-product-page-embed` product-template block is a setting-free custom
  placement anchor and takes precedence when visible.
- Page builders use the separate provider-neutral `bundle-page-builder-embed`
  block. It emits data only; `bundle-app-embed` continues to own signed
  resolution, Shopify CDN asset URLs, lazy runtime loading, and rendering.
  `eligible-product` mode becomes the preferred PPB custom anchor and reuses
  `/apps/product-bundles/api/ppb-embed.json`. `product-page-bundle` resolves an
  exact Active or Unlisted PPB by its generated parent-product handle, while
  `full-page-bundle` resolves an exact Active or Unlisted FPB by its per-shop
  public number through `/apps/product-bundles/api/page-builder-embed.json`.
  The first valid marker is authoritative. Existing parent-product PPB and FPB
  app-proxy roots win; direct page-builder modes suppress automatic PPB builder
  initialization so only one primary bundle builder exists per page.
- Before opening a PPB storefront preview, the preview flow first synchronizes the selected product template, then posts to the dedicated authenticated `/validate-widget-placement` JSON resource route. That route reads the parent product's effective `templateSuffix`, inspects that product JSON template in the MAIN theme, and verifies an app block owned by the current app with handle `bundle-product-page`. The placement check must not post to the rendered configure document route because an embedded document response can be HTML rather than the JSON contract expected by the client. Missing, malformed, or unreadable template data fails closed and opens Shopify's Theme Editor deep link for that exact template and product. A parent product alone is not evidence that the PPB widget is installed.

### FPB Bootstrap Idempotency and First-Paint Reservation

The app embed and the FPB bundle have two legitimate initialization triggers: the embed's script-load callback and the bundle's own DOM-ready bootstrap. They can overlap on app-proxy pages. The FPB entry point must synchronously claim the container with `data-initializing` before constructing a controller, set `data-initialized` only after successful initialization, and release the in-progress claim in `finally` so a failed attempt remains retryable.

The app-proxy marker is server-rendered with `hidden` and is hydrated near the end of the document. Without earlier geometry, the theme footer can paint in the future widget area and then leave the viewport when the controller renders. The marker therefore contains one pure loading screen that reserves `100svh`; it never renders provisional product cards, summary content, or layout skeletons. `bundle-widget-bootstrap.css` is loaded from the app embed's schema into the document head so the screen does not depend on the main widget stylesheet. During hydration, the app embed moves the same loading screen into the FPB root and marks the root `aria-busy="true"`; widget initialization removes it and clears the busy state only after rendered bundle content is ready. The canonical app-proxy marker must contain this loading screen, and missing markup fails fast rather than invoking a compatibility path. Keep the bootstrap asset small and marker/root-specific because the enabled app embed loads it across storefront pages.

Settings -> Design owns the store-level loading appearance for FPB and PPB. `generalSettings.loadingScreen` carries an optional HTTPS GIF URL and a validated background color. The FPB app-proxy route reads those settings before first paint, renders the merchant GIF when present, and otherwise renders the default CSS spinner. The app embed transfers the values to the FPB controller, while the Shopify-hosted `ppb_storefront_runtime` metafield transfers the same values to PPB. Bootstrap, product loading, modal loading, and cart actions use that single store-level configuration; per-bundle PPB loading media is not part of the runtime. All eight presets use this loading screen.

Rendered FPB summaries have a separate empty-selection contract and are not a
loading state. When Product
Slots is disabled, Standard, Classic, Compact, and Horizontal all render the
same responsive product-row skeleton behavior on desktop and mobile. The
baseline target is two rows for a new bundle; an explicit larger quantity
requirement becomes the target, and each selected unit removes one skeleton.
When Product Slots is enabled, slot tiles own the empty state and summary
skeleton rows are not rendered.

The app embed is a separate small entry. It handles redirects and marker hydration, then loads the FPB asset only when a full-page marker exists. It must not import the FPB controller graph because the embed is enabled globally.

The app embed is also the sole FPB stylesheet loader. It loads the base,
mobile-summary, shared responsive, and active-preset assets in that order before
starting the widget runtime, and deduplicates links by resolved URL. This makes
the shared gutter, sidebar, and mobile-footer components the common default and
keeps each preset asset as the final visual override layer. The controller only
applies preset and summary markers; it does not create, disable, or switch
stylesheets during rendering.

Keep the embed runtime as an explicit deferred `asset_url` script after the
body marker unless initialization is redesigned. A schema-level `javascript`
asset is injected asynchronously into the document head and can execute before
the marker exists.

- FPB product-page upsells are owned by the global app-embed runtime. The embed supplies product, collection, locale, selected-variant, and signed endpoint context. `/apps/product-bundles/api/fpb-upsells.json` returns only shop-scoped eligible public offers and uses short private caching with ETag revalidation.
- `bundle-upsell` is a setting-free custom-placement anchor. The first visible custom anchor wins; otherwise the runtime inserts once below the primary product add-to-cart form through a bounded observer. The runtime never falls back to arbitrary body placement and renders no shell for empty or failed responses.
- Product-page clicks capture the currently selected variant into a ten-minute, bundle-scoped, consume-once session handoff. The shared FPB controller reconciles only the exact available variant into the first matching enabled paid step and refreshes the existing desktop sidebar and mobile footer from `selectedProducts`. This flow is template-neutral across Standard, Classic, Compact, and Horizontal.
- PPB Bundle Embed uses the same global loader but a separate signed
  `/apps/product-bundles/api/ppb-embed.json` contract. It returns one
  shop-scoped Active or Unlisted PPB selected by `createdAt ASC, id ASC`, plus
  localized title/subtitle and the browsed-product preselection flag. Responses
  use private 30-second ETag caching.
- The PPB embed host consumes the endpoint's preloaded formatted bundle instead
  of making the parent-product configuration request. It marks the controller
  as an embed source, preventing controller relocation and native price/dynamic
  checkout hiding. Product Page CSS/runtime load only after a non-null eligible
  response. Section reload reconciliation reuses the request result and never
  creates a second widget.
- A visible `bundle-product-page-embed` anchor wins; otherwise the host mounts
  immediately before the first visible primary Add to Cart control. Exact
  available current-variant preselection runs only when enabled and no shopper
  session selection was restored.
- Direct page-builder responses use private 30-second ETag caching and preload
  the formatted bundle. Direct PPB sets the existing embed-source contract and
  therefore never relocates itself or hides native product price, dynamic
  checkout, or product forms. Direct FPB marks its signed inline configuration
  as `app_proxy`, preserving the canonical full-page load priority and avoiding
  a second configuration request. Section reloads reuse the resolved payload.
- PageFly and GemPages should use their Shopify App elements to place
  `bundle-page-builder-embed`. Shogun custom layouts can emit the same plain
  HTML marker because it contains no Shopify Liquid or external asset URL.
- Full-page bundle public links use the signed app-proxy document URL (`/apps/product-bundles/wpb/{publicNumber}`). The positive integer is unique per shop and hides the internal database ID. Shopify wraps `application/liquid` in the active theme layout and the app embed loads extension assets through `asset_url`.
- Storefront JS/CSS must be loaded from Shopify theme-extension assets with Liquid `asset_url`. App proxy routes are only for API/data responses, not widget asset hosting.

Cart-page discount progress is line-metadata driven and fails closed. FPB and
PPB cart-line builders retain an explicit `_bundle_tier_progress` marker with
`progressBar.enabled: false` when the merchant disables progress; they do not
omit that decision. Missing progress configuration is also disabled. Because
the cart page owns one global progress surface, it renders only when every
participating bundle-progress marker explicitly enables it. A mixed cart with
an enabled and disabled marker renders no global bar instead of combining
incompatible bundle rules or allowing an older enabled line to override the
merchant's current disabled choice.

Proxy URL ownership is centralized at each build boundary. TypeScript callers use
`app/config/storefront-proxy-routes.ts` for the installed proxy root and API or
document path composition. Theme-extension blocks read `storefrontProxyRoot`
from the existing Shopify-hosted `$app.ppb_storefront_runtime` JSON. The app
embed, direct Product Page entrypoint, and SDK initialize the bundled resolver
from that value before issuing proxy requests. Do not capture a
theme-app-extension snippet to construct a URL: Shopify wraps rendered extension
snippets in diagnostic HTML comments, and capturing that output corrupts URL
attributes. The production and SIT TOMLs retain the same `apps` prefix and their
required literal environment-specific `subpath` values because Shopify reads
those deployment manifests directly.

A PPB product-page preview may use the signed app proxy only after that hosted
runtime has supplied the proxy root. If the root is absent, the browser runtime
must fail closed without issuing a bundle request; it must not inject the
production `/apps/product-bundles` root. This prevents a partially synchronized
SIT preview from silently crossing into the production app. The production
constant remains only the non-browser default for server-side URL construction.

The signed Controls response uses the same resolver when it emits FPB
collection quick-add targets. It must never embed the production proxy root in
the response, because the SIT app is installed at `/apps/product-bundles-sit`
and a production-root target would silently hand the shopper to the wrong app.

## FPB Load Strategy

> **Do not modify the load order** — see `CLAUDE.md` → "Do Not Touch" section.

### Shopify Storefront Snapshot Marker

The app-proxy document writes the validated Shopify-hosted configuration and
FPB runtime into the marker. The widget accepts only a bundle-ID-matched
`data-bundle-config-source="shopify_storefront"` payload. Missing or malformed
snapshots fail before widget bootstrap; there is no bundle API, Page block, or
Page-body fallback stage.

### App Proxy Document — Public FPB Route

The public FPB route is `GET /apps/product-bundles/wpb/{publicNumber}`. Shopify forwards it to Remix as `/wpb/{publicNumber}` and app-proxy HMAC verification is required before lookup. The route rejects non-positive or opaque path segments and resolves by `(shopId, publicNumber)`. Preview-token authorization and the emitted widget marker remain bound to the resolved internal bundle ID.

The route performs one narrow database authorization lookup and one Storefront
GraphQL query for the parent variant's `$app.bundle_ui_config` plus the shop's
`$app.fpb_storefront_runtime`. It validates snapshot schema, identity, steps,
and runtime-policy revision before returning through Shopify's `liquid()`
helper. Active and unlisted bundles render publicly; drafts require a one-hour
shop-and-bundle-bound `wpb_preview` token. Unrestricted public documents use a
short shared cache; preview and delivery-restricted responses are private and
non-cacheable. Missing or mismatched Shopify state returns `503`.

### Interaction-Only Product Modal

The initial full-page asset excludes the product-detail modal and DOMPurify.
The app embed passes the Shopify `asset_url` for
`bundle-widget-full-page-modal.js`; the controller loads it only when a shopper
opens product details or an enabled Judge.me badge needs rich-HTML sanitation.
Plain product-card descriptions are reduced to text with an inert template and
do not require the sanitizer.

## Product Hydration Strategy

PPB product hydration is demand-driven. Opening, navigating, or auto-advancing
the picker calls the canonical `loadStepProducts()` owner only for the active
destination step. The retired `preloadNextStep()` layer speculatively requested
the following step without owning Shopify caching, request deduplication, or a
platform contract, and could fetch product data the shopper never viewed.
Foreground loading and its fail-closed error surface remain the sole authority.

This is consistent with Shopify's storefront performance guidance to load app
code only where it is needed, keep JavaScript work small, and reserve preload
for critical assets that the current page requires. Shopify does not define a
theme-app-extension contract for speculatively hydrating a future bundle step.
The decision to remove `preloadNextStep()` is therefore an application-level
inference from those documented principles, not a claim that Shopify exposes a
step-preload API. See [Storefront performance](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/performance/storefront)
and [Use defer and async on non-critical scripts](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/best-practices/performance/defer-scripts).

FPB follows the same demand-driven boundary. Its initial render hydrates only
the active step, and step navigation hydrates only the destination step before
rendering that catalog. The retired `preloadAllSteps()` layer requested every
unseen step after each successful foreground load, competing with the active
storefront for product requests and silently discarding background failures.
Shopify's [theme performance guidance](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/best-practices/performance)
reserves preload for a small number of critical resources, while its
[app performance guidance](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/performance/general-best-practices)
recommends loading non-critical resources on interaction. Those principles do
not justify that application-owned future-step request layer.

### Native product-form actions

When the PPB block's **Hide native buttons** setting is enabled, the block hides
the theme product form, accelerated checkout controls, and Horizon's native
`sticky-add-to-cart` element. Horizon's sticky control submits the neutral
bundle-parent variant through the theme product form; it does not know the
shopper's selected component variants or Wolfpack's Cart Transform
authorization. It therefore cannot be reused as the PPB bundle action. The
bundle widget's existing validated add path remains the only cart mutation
owner. Theme-specific event interception or product-form rewriting is not a
supported integration path.

The optional PPB sticky action is app-owned because Shopify does not provide a
native sticky control that understands buyer-selected bundle components. It is
mounted only for the persisted desktop/mobile targets and hidden while the
canonical PPB CTA intersects the viewport. `scroll_to_offers` returns the
shopper to the existing bundle selection surface. `add_selected_offer`
delegates exactly once to the canonical PPB CTA when that CTA is enabled; when
it is disabled, the action returns to the incomplete bundle surface instead.
It owns no cart payload, request, validation, inventory, pending, error, or
redirect logic.

### Schedule-derived Countdown

Both storefront widgets consume one nullable `countdown` runtime object. Its
`endsAt` value is serialized only from `OfferPolicy.endsAt`; disabled
presentation, missing schedules, and invalid instants produce `null`. The
shared renderer recomputes remaining time from `Date.now()` every second and on
document visibility changes, so background tabs and clock jumps do not create
decrement drift. Active ticks use `role="timer"` with `aria-live="off"`; only a
merchant-configured expiry message may become a polite status announcement.

There is no visitor-reset duration, midnight mode, countdown analytics event,
or transition job. A fresh storefront eligibility decision remains the owner
of whether an expired scheduled offer is visible at all.

### Product-Page Block Stage — Shopify-Hosted Snapshot

The PPB app block serializes only a complete schema-v3
`$app.bundle_ui_config` into `data-bundle-config`. Compact v2 pointers are
retired for this surface and are not fetched through the app proxy.
`bundle_ui_config` has one identity field, `id`, and requires exact
`bundleType: "product_page"`; a missing type is invalid rather than a PPB
default. Its derived pricing rules use only `gte`, `gt`, `lte`, `lt`, and `eq`.
Long-form step-condition operators remain a separate contract.

Runtime behavior in `app/assets/widgets/product-page/methods/config-lifecycle-methods.js`:

1. Accept only a complete schema-v3 Product Page snapshot with signed v2
   authorization.
2. Read store controls from `$app.storefront_controls_runtime`, and locale data
   plus the Storefront API version/token from the Shopify-hosted shop
   `$app.ppb_storefront_runtime` metafield emitted by
   Liquid. The direct parent-product block emits this context in its JSON
   payload; automatic and direct page-builder PPB surfaces receive the same
   owning snapshot from the app-embed marker before the widget runtime starts.
   Read exact Design CSS from `$app.ppb_storefront_css`. Controls are never
   refetched through an app proxy. FPB localized copy is resolved locally from
   `$app.fpb_storefront_runtime` using exact locale, base locale, then English.
3. Hydrate product and variant state directly from Shopify Storefront API;
   category and collection membership is already materialized at sync time.
4. If the snapshot is missing/invalid:
   - show theme editor preview when in editor mode and `bundleId` exists
   - otherwise hide the container on storefront

The schema-v3 snapshot also carries a safe `offerDelivery` marker containing
`decisionRequired`, `specificLinkRequired`, and `ruleVersion`. When a link or
schedule requires a decision, both the standard PPB widget and SDK mode call the
signed app-proxy eligibility endpoint before exposing bundle state. The opaque
`wpb_offer` URL token is forwarded only when present and is mandatory only for a
specific-link policy. Missing required tokens, inactive schedules, rejected
decisions, and endpoint failures hide the widget. When no decision is required,
initialization remains network-free.

Server discovery for PPB embeds and FPB upsells filters inactive schedules,
orders effective offers by ascending `OfferPolicy.priority` with bundle ID as a
stable tie-break, and truncates after the first eligible
`stopLowerPriority=true` policy. Page-builder delivery enforces the same
schedule decision. Link-only bundles remain excluded from discovery surfaces so
the generated direct link is their sole entry point. These rules govern
Wolfpack storefront visibility and selection; Shopify discount dates and
combination rules remain owned by Shopify discount APIs.

Recurring schedules are evaluated at request time from the saved local calendar
rule and Shopify's `shop.ianaTimezone`; there is no transition job. Weekly and
monthly windows use start-inclusive/end-exclusive boundaries, monthly anchors
skip months that do not contain the requested day, and malformed rules fail
closed. The PPB Shopify-hosted snapshot carries only the safe decision marker;
when recurrence requires a server decision, the widget calls the signed
eligibility endpoint before exposing the static bundle data.

There is no Wolfpack fallback for this surface. Storefront API failure fails
closed rather than rendering stale catalog or price data. See
[[Architecture/Storefront Outage Resilience]].

PPB direct default-product configuration contributes only the canonical Shopify
product ID, variant ID, and merchant-authored required quantity at runtime. The
widget adds those product IDs to step-zero Storefront hydration and reconstructs
the compulsory lines from the matching live variant. Saved picker title, image,
price, availability, and inventory fields are never commerce or rendering
fallbacks. A missing runtime, missing product, missing configured variant, or
partial response clears the direct-default render data and leaves step zero in
the existing hydration-failure state, which blocks add to cart.

Storefront product DTOs preserve `MoneyV2.currencyCode` with decimal amounts.
The browser converts those amounts to integer presentment minor units and does
not apply another currency conversion. Merchant-authored absolute pricing
values are converted once using Shopify's presentment rate; display uses
`Intl.NumberFormat` for the preserved currency code. Shopify Liquid supplies
the base and customer currency context for direct, automatic, and page-builder
surfaces. Missing base currency or a missing non-base presentment rate fails
closed; the runtime never assumes USD or silently applies a rate of one.

### Limited-release Product Page SDK

SDK mode preserves the public `window.WolfpackBundles` global and method names,
but it does not expose configuration immediately after parsing. The SDK accepts
the same complete schema-v3 Product Page snapshot as the normal PPB block,
projects the active locale, evaluates offer eligibility, and then uses
`fetchPpbStorefrontProducts` plus the normal PPB product processor to hydrate
current Shopify products and variants. `wbp:ready` is dispatched only after all
configured product IDs have resolved and normalization completes.

Invalid configuration, missing `$app.ppb_storefront_runtime` Storefront API
credentials, and hydration failure keep the container hidden and dispatch
`wbp:init-failed` with `INVALID_CONFIGURATION`,
`MISSING_STOREFRONT_RUNTIME`, or `PRODUCT_HYDRATION_FAILED`. An ineligible offer
remains silently hidden. No SDK global is exposed on any failed path.

The state getter freezes copied step/pricing configuration and returns copied
selection maps. SDK mutations accept positive integer quantities and only
known, available hydrated variants. The shared PPB condition-selection adapter
maps selected variants to their parent products for category rules and supplies
hydrated cent and gram metrics for amount and weight rules. Rejected mutations
do not change selection state. Successful mutation events use `quantity` in
their detail payload. Cart submission uses `Shopify.actions.updateCart`,
matching FPB and the standard PPB runtime.

The SDK is support-enabled and limited to one Product Page Bundle runtime on an
Online Store 2.0 page. There is no npm, public CDN, Hydrogen, or Full Page
Bundle distribution. The public guide is `/developers/sdk/` on the static Only
Bundles website.

## Build Process

Source files use ES modules. Shopify extensions require bundled IIFEs.

```bash
npm run build:widgets          # build all
npm run build:widgets:full-page
npm run build:widgets:product-page
npm run build:sdk
```

**Forgetting to build = storefront sees old code.**

---

## Widget Version

`widgetVersion` is defined in `scripts/build-storefront.mjs`.
Embedded as `window.__BUNDLE_WIDGET_VERSION__` in every bundled file.

Verify live version in DevTools:

```javascript
console.log(window.__BUNDLE_WIDGET_VERSION__);
```

Version bump rules:
| Change | Bump |
|---|---|
| Bug fix | PATCH |
| New storefront feature | MINOR |
| Breaking change / redesign | MAJOR |

**Mandatory before every deploy**: increment version → build → check CSS file sizes → deploy.

### CSS Size Limit

Shopify enforces **100,000 B** on app block CSS assets.

```bash
wc -c extensions/bundle-builder/assets/*.css
```

Keep base CSS below the limit by moving template-specific rules into separate extension assets:

- FPB base: `bundle-widget-full-page.css`
- FPB templates: `bundle-widget-full-page-{standard,classic,compact,horizontal}.css`
- PPB base: `bundle-widget.css`
- PPB templates: `bundle-widget-product-page-{cascade,cognive,modal}.css`

The current CSS minifier does not preserve the descendant combinator before a
leading `:is(...)` selector. Write those rules as explicit comma-separated
selectors and verify the generated asset; otherwise `.parent :is(.child-a,
.child-b)` can be emitted as `.parent:is(...)` and silently stop matching.

## Placeholder Media Strategy

- Bundle product placeholders now render from a local AVIF artifact:
  - `/bundle-product-placeholder.avif`
- App fallback still accepts `/bundle-product-placeholder.png` for backward compatibility in browsers or clients that do not decode AVIF or when an image transport path does not support AVIF.
- The fallback is applied at image render time (`onerror`), so the UI keeps working in all supported storefront clients without regressing existing media URLs.
- `public/bundle-product-placeholder.svg` has been decommissioned and should not be used anymore.

The app embed exposes the extension asset URLs and loads exactly one active
preset stylesheet. Its core bundle owns environment selection, Shopify-hosted
context, and FPB marker hydration. It then loads independent product, Controls,
and cart feature bundles only when their page/runtime gates match. Cart features
also load on the first `shopify:cart:view` or `shopify:cart:lines-update` event,
so a product-page cart drawer remains supported without paying the cart runtime
cost on every initial page load. The widget runtime must not take over
stylesheet ownership.
Do not solve the limit by minifying readable source into one-line CSS; remove
redundant or conflicting rules and split assets only along real ownership
boundaries.

The same document may not bootstrap more than one Only Bundles app embed. Each
app-embed entry containing the ownership guard resolves its adjacent Shopify
marker, but proceeds only when that marker is the sole
`[data-wpb-app-embed]` owner in the document. Once this runtime version is
released in both PROD and SIT, two active embeds make both current entries stop
before they publish shared storefront globals, register section listeners,
fetch settings, or hydrate a bundle surface. During a staged rollout, an older
deployed entry cannot be controlled retroactively, so the dormant environment
must remain disabled. The diagnostic reports all observed proxy roots; it never
chooses an environment from document or script load order. Theme-level
activation remains the source of truth for which environment owns the page.

The app embed must map canonical uppercase FPB preset IDs to explicit
`DOMStringMap` properties: `presetStandard`, `presetClassic`, `presetCompact`,
and `presetHorizontal`. Do not derive a dataset property as
`preset${preset}`; an uppercase preset such as `STANDARD` would look for the
nonexistent `presetSTANDARD` property and silently leave the widget with only
base CSS. A base-only render can appear functional, so live verification must
also confirm that the expected dedicated template stylesheet is loaded.

### Native DOM and trusted content boundaries

Storefront browser renderers construct elements and fragments with DOM APIs.
Dynamic text is assigned through `textContent`, mutable regions are replaced
with `replaceChildren`, and handlers are attached with event listeners. Shared
renderers return `HTMLElement` or `DocumentFragment` values through
`create*Element` and `create*Fragment` APIs; string-returning component
generators and HTML-valued child arguments are not part of the runtime
contract.

Two rich-content inputs retain formatting through
`sanitizeRichHtmlFragment`: Shopify product descriptions use the
`product-description` profile and provider review badges use the
`review-badge` profile. Both profiles reject scripts, embedded documents,
forms, inline styles, event attributes, and unsafe URLs, then return a detached
sanitized fragment that callers append directly. Merchant discount templates
never enter that boundary. `formatMessageSegments` produces text, condition,
and discount segments, and `createMessageFragment` creates only the known
emphasis elements while rendering templates and substituted values as text.

Fetched Shopify section markup has one separate boundary:
`parseThemeSectionResponse` accepts only successful same-origin HTML responses,
requires the requested selector, and imports the selected node into the active
document. Do not add another general HTML parser or move this boundary into
ordinary component rendering.

### Runtime styling boundary

Static layout and presentation belong in source CSS. Runtime styling is limited
to values that are inherently data-driven, such as measured timeline progress,
timeline entry counts, Shopify-provided variant swatch color, and merchant-authored
Custom CSS. The runtime must not inject structural widths, heights, spacing,
display state, or template stylesheets. Native attributes such as `hidden` and
state markers such as `data-fpb-summary-mode` own visibility and responsive
branching.

All legitimate runtime stylesheets are owned by `replaceManagedStyle`. A caller
supplies a stable key and already validated CSS; the helper creates, replaces,
or removes the single matching `<style>` element. Settings Controls CSS is
processed by the existing CSS pipeline when saved and again when projected
into the public runtime response. Bundle-level CSS retains its existing payload
contract and managed-style lifecycle. PPB Design CSS is rendered exactly from
Shopify-hosted `$app.ppb_storefront_css` by Liquid; it is not fetched from an
app-owned stylesheet endpoint. Static presentation belongs in the raw widget CSS sources, while
validated colors, counts, and percentages may cross the DOM boundary only as
CSS custom properties.

The FPB floating promo badge remains fixed at its established bottom-left
desktop position. In mobile summary mode, CSS derives the complete sticky dock
block size from the dock's shared spacing, control, border, and safe-area tokens,
then places the badge one standard gap above it. The existing
`data-fpb-summary-mode="tray"` state activates that branch. Do not replace this
with a fixed viewport offset or JavaScript geometry injection: both would drift
from the mobile footer and can obscure its summary or checkout action.

The FPB desktop summary and mobile tray rebuild their contents after selection
changes. Simple and Step-Based discount-progress transitions must therefore
read the visible fill percentage before clearing the old summary DOM, render
the replacement at that percentage, and move it to the new target on the
following frames. A transition declared only on the fill width cannot animate
across an element replacement. Initial renders and reduced-motion mode apply
the target immediately.

### Discount Tier Pill Feedback

Widget version `12.3.0` adds shared color-only feedback for pricing tiers when
`pricing.enabled` is true. Immediately before a selection mutation, the FPB and
PPB controllers capture the effective pricing tier; after a successful mutation,
the normal selection events and totals/pills rerender complete before the shared
transition helper compares the new tier. An advance dispatches one
`wpb:discount-tier-reached` event from the widget root. Custom SDK mode dispatches
the equivalent `wbp:discount-tier-reached` event after its normal selection
event. Both use this detail contract:

```ts
{
  bundleId: string;
  tierId: string;
  tierIndex: number; // zero-based
  tierCount: number;
  feedbackState: "tier" | "complete";
}
```

Initial hydration, restored selection state, same-tier changes, downgrades,
failed mutations, and disabled pricing do not emit. A later re-earned tier emits
again, a multi-tier jump emits once for its highest newly reached tier, and a
single configured tier is a completion.

The widget-root listener applies `data-wpb-discount-feedback` to every currently
mounted eligible pricing/count pill. The shared FPB/PPB stylesheet animates only
background and text colors: an intermediate tier uses one 650 ms beat, while
completion uses two beats over 1.2 seconds. The listener then removes the state
attribute so each pill returns to its owned appearance. Reduced-motion mode holds
the selected colors for the same duration without animation before restoration.

Merchant colors are stored under `pageCustomization.stylePresets.colors` as
`discountTierBackgroundColor`, `discountTierTextColor`,
`discountCompletionBackgroundColor`, and `discountCompletionTextColor`. They are
published as `--bundle-discount-feedback-tier-bg`,
`--bundle-discount-feedback-tier-text`,
`--bundle-discount-feedback-complete-bg`, and
`--bundle-discount-feedback-complete-text`.

### Merchant Pricing Tier Badges

Widget version `16.0.2` projects the optional canonical
`pricing.rules[].tierBadge` object to FPB and PPB. The shared renderer supports
`pill`, `folded`, and `banner_rounded` shapes and either `always` or `selected`
visibility. PPB attaches badges to its bundle-quantity tier pills; FPB attaches
them to stepped progress milestones. Badge presentation is owned by the shared
raw stylesheet and uses validated CSS custom properties for merchant-selected
foreground and background colors.

Static badge copy is valid for every pricing method. The
`{{saved_percentage}}` variable is valid only for percentage rules and
percentage Buy X, get Y rules; `{{saved_total}}` is valid only for fixed-amount
rules. The Admin and runtime share this truthfulness boundary. Missing or
invalid values suppress the badge instead of presenting fabricated savings.
The rendered text remains part of the tier's accessible description, and
selected-only badges follow the existing keyboard-operable tier-selection
state.

## Cache Busting

Shopify CDN `asset_url` filter appends `?v=HASH` — this hash only changes on `shopify app deploy`. Custom query params are NOT on the allowlist. Always deploy after widget changes.

Storefront JS/CSS loading strategy: FPB and Product Page bundle blocks load assets from Shopify theme-extension assets with Liquid `asset_url`. App proxy remains for API/data routes only.

### JS/CSS Asset Skew

Do not trust `window.__BUNDLE_WIDGET_VERSION__` by itself for CSS-only or CSS-heavy storefront fixes. The value proves the served JS bundle executed, but Product Page template CSS is a separate Shopify extension asset such as `bundle-widget-product-page-cascade.css`.

Observed 2026-07-13 in SIT: the storefront served `bundle-widget-product-page-bundled.js` with `window.__BUNDLE_WIDGET_VERSION__ = "5.0.145"` while the exact Shopify CDN `bundle-widget-product-page-cascade.css` still lacked `--bw-ppb-cascade-action-radius` and still contained the older `border-radius:100px` Product List quantity-wrapper rule. The local generated CSS asset was correct.

For storefront visual proof after CSS changes:

- Hard reload after clearing Cache Storage.
- Record `window.__BUNDLE_WIDGET_VERSION__`.
- Record the exact active CSS asset URL.
- Fetch the active CSS asset URL and verify the expected token/rule is present.
- Then measure computed styles. If JS is current but CSS is stale, proof is blocked by extension asset propagation/deploy state, not by the source patch.

### Dev Preview Asset 404 / ORB Failure

When a Shopify CLI dev preview asset hash expires or points at a missing theme-extension build, the storefront can still emit normal Liquid `asset_url` script/link tags while the referenced `https://cdn.shopify.com/extensions/.../dev-.../assets/...` URLs return Shopify `404` HTML. Chrome then reports the subresource loads as `net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_ORB` or CORB because the browser requested CSS/JS but received `text/html`.

Do not diagnose that state as a widget boot or Classic template bug until the asset URL is checked directly. Required proof:

- Hard reload the storefront with cache bypass after clearing Cache Storage.
- Verify `window.__BUNDLE_WIDGET_VERSION__`; a missing value means the widget JS did not execute.
- Open or fetch the exact blocked asset URL. If it returns Shopify `404: Page not found` with `content-type: text/html`, the live proof is blocked by the dev-extension asset state, not by storefront source.
- Compare against any older already-open tab before trusting it. A stale tab can keep a previous dev asset hash and `window.__BUNDLE_WIDGET_VERSION__` while fresh tabs point at a newer missing hash.

After restarting the Shopify CLI dev session, a cache-bypassed reload can retain
the obsolete theme-extension preview handle even when the visible product URL is
unchanged. Reopen the storefront through the Admin **Preview Bundle** action or
the active CLI preview link to obtain the current preview binding, then clear
Cache Storage and hard-reload. Confirm that the `dev-<handle>` changed and its
assets return `200` before using the page as runtime or visual evidence.
