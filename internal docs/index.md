# Only Bundles — Internal Docs

This vault contains audited, authoritative documentation for the Only Bundles app. All files have been cross-referenced against the actual codebase, Prisma schema, extension TOMLs, and the Shopify Dev MCP before writing.

This tracked vault is the authoritative architecture and operations reference for the application. The broader feature, audit, and implementation-record index is [`docs/README.md`](../docs/README.md).
