# Cart Transform API

## Current Config

```toml
api_version = "2025-10"
target = "cart.transform.run"
```

## Failure policy

`CartTransformService` creates the active transform with
`blockOnFailure: false`. If Shopify cannot execute the Function, Shopify may
continue with the unmodified cart instead of preventing every cart mutation in
the shop. This graceful-degradation policy protects ordinary product sales from
a Function-wide outage. A failed transform can also leave selected bundle
components unmerged and undiscounted, so executable Function verification and
post-release monitoring remain required; graceful degradation is not a
substitute for a healthy Function.

The setup flow queries `blockOnFailure` together with the active Function ID. A
matching Rust transform is reusable only when the value is `false`; a blocking
registration is deleted and recreated with graceful degradation.
`completeSetup()` runs during install, explicit storefront sync, and the
separately approved Cart Transform repair operation.

## Target status

| Target | Status |
|---|---|
| `purchase.cart-transform.run` | Deprecated since 2025-07 |
| `cart.transform.run` | Current and configured |

## Operation Names (2025-07+)

| Pre-2025-07 | 2025-07+ (current) |
|---|---|
| `merge` | `linesMerge` |
| `expand` | `lineExpand` |
| `update` | `lineUpdate` |

**Always use the new names.** The codebase already uses them.

## MERGE Consolidation Behaviour

Shopify consolidates `linesMerge` results that share the same `parentVariantId` + `title`. The `attributes` field does NOT prevent consolidation.

To keep duplicate bundle instances as separate line items: **append a unique suffix to the title** (e.g., `"Bundle Name (2)"`). Tracked via `bundleNameCounts` Map in the transform function.

## Function Input Runtime Token

The configured MERGE path reads `_wolfpack_bundle_runtime` from each selected cart line and verifies it with the secret inside the CartTransform owner configuration metafield:

```graphql
cartTransform {
  runtimeConfiguration: metafield(namespace: "$app", key: "runtime_configuration") {
    value
  }
}
cart {
  lines {
    runtimeToken: attribute(key: "_wolfpack_bundle_runtime") {
      value
    }
  }
}
```

`runtime_configuration` is JSON containing `runtimeTokenSecret` and
`bundleCartLineMessaging`. Keeping both values in one metafield, together with
querying only `__typename` to detect a selling-plan allocation, keeps the input
query at Shopify's maximum calculated complexity of 30. Adding another leaf or
metafield requires reducing or consolidating an existing selection first.
Routine Cart Transform setup reads and merges the current JSON before rotating
the deterministic secret so it does not erase saved cart-line messaging.

Offer analytics reuses the selected `_bundle_display_properties` attribute.
The storefront places one normalized `offerAnalytics` object inside that JSON;
MERGE emits it as one `_wpb_offer_analytics` JSON property on the parent line,
and unmerged component lines retain the nested input shape. Do not select the
five offer dimensions as separate Function input attributes: that raised the
calculated complexity to 35 and Shopify rejected the build on 2026-09-01.

The token is issued only by the signed app-proxy route `/apps/product-bundles/api/cart-transform-runtime-token`. It validates the current DB bundle config before signing selected component/add-on variant GIDs, quantities, parent variant, and pricing config.

## Function Input Metafield Namespacing

The EXPAND/display path still reads parent bundle metadata from app-owned product variant metafields. In a Function input query, those fields must include the `$app` namespace explicitly:

```graphql
metafield(namespace: "$app", key: "component_parents") {
  value
}
```

Do not query app-owned component/pricing metafields by key only. The app writers define and write `component_reference`, `component_quantities`, `price_adjustment`, and `component_pricing` under `$app`; omitting the namespace makes EXPAND/display metadata unavailable.

## Checkout Discount Allocation Boundary

Shopify's 2025-10 Cart Transform contract does not permit merge, expand, or
update operations for cart lines that have a selling plan. FPB and PPB subscription
component lines therefore remain separate and Cart Transform emits no operation
for their group. A product Discount Function owns any signed Wolfpack bundle
price adjustment on those lines. The initial-order automatic discount uses
`recurringCycleLimit=1`; a recurring node may use `0` only after live recurring
checkout proof.

`lineUpdate` can set an adjusted fixed unit price, title, or image for a cart
line, but it does not create a named Shopify discount allocation row in cart or
checkout output. For FPB paid add-ons this means Cart Transform can make the
selected add-on charge `74610` instead of `82900`, but checkout will not show an
EB-style native `ADD ON (-...)` discount row or original/discounted price labels
from that operation alone.

Exact EB parity for paid add-on checkout reductions requires a Discount Function
path that emits a product discount candidate/message for the selected add-on
line; otherwise Checkout UI must stay inert and Cart Transform remains only the
price-adjustment source.

2026-06-30 implementation note: `extensions/bundle-discount-function` provides
the product Discount Function query and Rust logic for `_bundle_step_type`
values such as `addon:PERCENTAGE:10` and emits product discount candidates with
message `Add On`. `AddOnDiscountFunctionService` creates the matching automatic
app discount with EB-aligned settings: `discountClasses: ["PRODUCT"]` and
`combinesWith.orderDiscounts/productDiscounts: true`,
`combinesWith.shippingDiscounts: false`. The app config must request both
`read_discounts` and `write_discounts`; Shopify schema validation reports both
scopes for the activation flow. Cart Transform no longer emits a paid add-on
`lineUpdate` fixed unit price for selected add-on lines, otherwise the selected
add-on can be discounted twice once the Discount Function is active.

2026-07-08 correction: add-on percentage markers are honored only when `_wolfpack_bundle_runtime` verifies that the selected add-on variant, quantity, and percentage are authorized. Unsigned or tampered add-on markers emit no product discount candidate.
